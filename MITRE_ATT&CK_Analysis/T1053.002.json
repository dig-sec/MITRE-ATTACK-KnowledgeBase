    "description": "Adversaries may abuse the `at.exe` utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The [at](S0110) utility exists as an executable within Windows for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Using [at](S0110) requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group.\nAn adversary may use `at.exe` in Windows environments to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. [at](S0110) can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM).\nNote: The `at.exe` command line utility has been deprecated in current versions of Windows in favor of `schtasks`.",

(Citation: Twitter Leoloobeek Scheduled Task) If scheduled tasks are not used for persistence, then the adversary is likely to remove the task when the action is complete. Monitor Windows Task Scheduler stores in %systemroot%System32Tasks for change entries related to scheduled tasks that do not correlate with known software, patch cycles, etc.\nConfigure event logging for scheduled task creation and changes by enabling the \"Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational\" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including: (Citation: TechNet Scheduled Task Events)(Citation: Microsoft Scheduled Task Events Win10)\n* Event ID 106 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 - Scheduled task registered\n* Event ID 140 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 / 4702 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task updated\n* Event ID 141 on Windows 7, Server 2008 R2 / 4699 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task deleted\n* Event ID 4698 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task created\n* Event ID 4700 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task enabled\n* Event ID 4701 on Windows 10, Server 2016 - Scheduled task disabled\nTools such as Sysinternals Autoruns may also be used to detect system changes that could be attempts at persistence, including listing current scheduled tasks. (Citation: TechNet Autoruns)\nRemote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to perform these functions outside of typical system utilities. Tasks may also be created through Windows system management tools such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](T1047) and [PowerShell](T1059.001), so additional logging may need to be configured to gather the appropriate data.",
