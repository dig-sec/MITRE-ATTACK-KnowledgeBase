If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, an attacker may opt to exfiltrate data using a Bluetooth communication channel.\nAdversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access and proximity. Bluetooth connections might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.",
