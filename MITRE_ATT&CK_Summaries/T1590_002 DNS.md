# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detecting DNS Reconnaissance Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that leverage containers to conduct DNS reconnaissance activities, which aim at evading traditional security monitoring and analysis.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1590.002 - DNS
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Environment)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/002)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy is designed to identify and alert on suspicious DNS queries made from within containerized environments. The primary data sources include:

1. **Container Logs:** Monitoring logs from container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker.
2. **DNS Traffic Data:** Analysis of network traffic for unusual DNS request patterns originating from containers.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Excessive DNS requests that deviate from normal baseline behavior.
- Queries to rare or suspicious domains indicative of reconnaissance activities.
- Use of known malicious domain indicators from threat intelligence feeds.

## Technical Context
In real-world scenarios, adversaries exploit container environments due to their dynamic and isolated nature. By spinning up containers for short-lived sessions, they can execute DNS queries while attempting to bypass traditional detection mechanisms that are more static or host-based in nature.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:** Adversaries may use commands like `nslookup`, `dig`, or custom scripts within containerized environments to perform DNS lookups.
- **Test Scenarios:** Emulate this technique by setting up a container that executes scripted, frequent DNS queries targeting uncommon domains. Observe how these activities differ from the baseline of expected behavior.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
### Known Limitations:
- Detection may not be effective against highly sophisticated adversaries who use obfuscation techniques or low-and-slow DNS querying patterns.
- Assumes access to comprehensive container logs and network traffic data, which might not be available in all environments.

### Assumptions:
- It assumes that baseline DNS behavior for containers is well-understood and established.
- Relies on up-to-date threat intelligence feeds for domain reputation analysis.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate applications within containers performing periodic DNS checks or updates, especially during initial setup phases.
- Automated container deployments that involve configuration scripts using DNS queries to check connectivity.
- Development and testing environments where DNS queries are a normal part of application testing.

## Priority
The severity is assessed as **Medium**. While DNS reconnaissance using containers can be an effective method for adversaries, the detection strategy is robust enough to mitigate common patterns, though it may not cover all sophisticated techniques.

### Justification:
- Containers are widely used in modern environments, making this vector relevant.
- The impact of undetected reconnaissance could lead to further stages of an attack, but containment and remediation processes can still be effective if alerts are timely.

## Response
Upon the alert firing:

1. **Verify Context:** Confirm whether the DNS queries correlate with known benign operations or legitimate use cases within your environment.
2. **Investigate Source:** Trace back to identify which container is generating suspicious activity and review its purpose, origin, and associated configurations.
3. **Containment:** If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate the affected containers and networks to prevent further reconnaissance or lateral movement.
4. **Alert Incident Response Team:** Provide detailed information about the alert for further analysis and potential incident escalation.
