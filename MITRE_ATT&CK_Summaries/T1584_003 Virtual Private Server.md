# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts that utilize containerization technology to bypass security monitoring systems. These adversaries often exploit the isolation and resource abstraction features provided by containers, allowing them to execute malicious activities while evading traditional detection mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Execution)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of container-specific data sources, including logs from orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and Docker, as well as network traffic monitoring. Patterns indicative of adversarial behavior are analyzed, such as unusual container deployment patterns, anomalous resource consumption, and unexpected network communications originating from containers.

Key data sources include:
- **Container Logs:** Monitor for suspicious activities in container lifecycle events.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Detect irregular outbound connections from containers.
- **Resource Utilization Metrics:** Identify spikes or anomalies in CPU, memory, or disk usage that deviate from normal operations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit containers by:
- Deploying malicious containers to host malware.
- Using container orchestration platforms for command and control (C2) activities.
- Leveraging containers' ephemeral nature to evade detection.

Common adversary techniques include:
- **Container Escape:** Attempting to break out of a container into the host system.
- **Sidecar Pattern Abuse:** Utilizing legitimate sidecar processes within containers to hide malicious activities.
- **Persistent Threats through Container Images:** Injecting malicious code into publicly available container images.

### Adversary Emulation
To emulate this technique, adversaries might use commands like:
```bash
docker run -d --name my-malicious-container <malicious_image>
```
or manipulate orchestration configurations in Kubernetes to deploy suspicious workloads.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection mechanisms may not cover all container platforms equally, especially custom or less common solutions.
- **Assumptions:** It is assumed that containers are deployed within a monitored environment where logs and network traffic can be captured effectively. Also, assumes the availability of baselines for normal behavior to detect anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate high-resource applications running in containers.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks or updates causing temporary spikes in resource usage.
- Network scanning by security tools designed for vulnerability assessments.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability of adversaries to use containers to bypass traditional detection mechanisms poses a significant threat. Containers are increasingly used in modern infrastructures, making them attractive targets for sophisticated attacks. Ensuring robust detection capabilities is critical to maintaining overall system security.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Analysis:** Quickly review the logs and network traffic associated with the suspicious container.
2. **Quarantine:** Isolate the affected container to prevent potential spread or further malicious activity.
3. **Investigate:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if the behavior is benign or indicative of an adversarial attempt.
4. **Remediation:** Remove any malicious containers and patch vulnerabilities that allowed the breach.
5. **Report:** Document findings and update detection rules to reduce false positives.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available. However, organizations should consider consulting container security best practices and engaging with communities focused on container security for further insights and updates.
