# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the abuse of Windows Password Filter DLLs as described in MITRE ATT&CK T1556.002. This technique involves loading malicious DLLs into the authentication process, allowing adversaries to manipulate passwords and potentially escalate privileges.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** [T1556.002 - Password Filter DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:**
  - Credential Access
  - Defense Evasion
  - Persistence
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring the registration and use of Password Filter DLLs. It leverages Windows event logs, registry modifications, and process creation events to identify suspicious activity related to this technique.

### Data Sources:
1. **Event Logs**: Analyzing security-related events for signs of DLL loading or changes in authentication packages.
2. **Registry Changes**: Monitoring for new entries or modifications in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Security Packages` key.
3. **Process and File Integrity**: Tracking processes that load suspicious DLLs.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Registration of unexpected or unauthorized Password Filter DLLs.
- Attempts to modify authentication packages via registry changes.
- Execution patterns where known malicious binaries attempt to load specific DLLs.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit the Password Filter mechanism by injecting a custom DLL into the authentication process, allowing them to manipulate passwords. This can be used for credential harvesting or privilege escalation. In real-world scenarios, adversaries often use tools like Mimikatz to automate these attacks.

### Adversary Emulation:
- **Sample Commands**: Use of PowerShell scripts or batch files to register a malicious Password Filter DLL.
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Registering a non-standard Password Filter DLL.
  - Modifying the registry key `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Security Packages`.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots**: 
  - Detection might miss custom or previously unknown malicious DLLs not identified by signature-based methods.
  - Obfuscated code within DLLs could evade simple pattern recognition.

- **Assumptions**:
  - The environment has comprehensive logging enabled for security events and registry changes.
  - Analysts have access to up-to-date threat intelligence feeds for identifying known malicious DLLs.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software using a Password Filter DLL for enhanced security features or multi-factor authentication mechanisms.
- System updates or maintenance tasks that involve changes in the Security Packages registry key.
- Misconfigured legitimate applications attempting to register their own Password Filters without malicious intent.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

The severity is high due to the potential impact on credential integrity and persistence within a compromised system. Unauthorized access to credentials can lead to significant security breaches, including lateral movement across networks and data exfiltration.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Set Up Test Environment**:
   - Use a virtual machine or isolated network environment to prevent unintended impacts.
   
2. **Install and Register Password Filter DLL**:
   - Create a benign test DLL using development tools like Visual Studio.
   - Use `regsvr32` to register the DLL as a Password Filter.
     ```bash
     regsvr32 path\to\test_password_filter.dll
     ```

3. **Modify Registry for Authentication Packages**:
   - Add or modify the registry key to include the test DLL.
     ```powershell
     Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Security Packages" -Name "" -Value "TestFilterPackage"
     ```

4. **Simulate Malicious Activity**:
   - Use tools like Mimikatz to demonstrate how an adversary might exploit the registered DLL.
   
5. **Monitor and Validate Detection**:
   - Check event logs, registry changes, and process activity for expected alerts.

## Response
When an alert is triggered indicating potential misuse of Password Filter DLLs:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Verify if a known or unknown malicious DLL has been registered.
   - Examine the source of the DLL registration (e.g., user actions, scripts).

2. **Containment**:
   - Disable the suspicious Password Filter through Group Policy or manually via registry changes.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Revert any unauthorized changes in authentication packages.
   - Conduct a thorough review of affected systems for additional compromises.

4. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document findings, including timestamps and involved processes.
   - Report to relevant stakeholders and update incident response plans as necessary.
