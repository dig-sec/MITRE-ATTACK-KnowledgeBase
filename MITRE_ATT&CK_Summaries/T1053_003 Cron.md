# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Use of Cron Jobs

## Goal
This detection technique aims to identify and alert on adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging cron jobs for malicious activities. This includes detecting adversaries using cron jobs to execute scripts that enable lateral movement, persistence, or privilege escalation within Linux and macOS environments.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on identifying suspicious activities involving cron jobs. This includes monitoring for unusual configurations and executions of cron jobs that may indicate an adversary's attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. The data sources leveraged include system logs, cron job configurations, and file integrity monitoring systems. Patterns analyzed include:

- Creation or modification of files within cron directories such as `/etc/cron.d`, `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/`.
- Execution of scripts from unexpected locations.
- Unusual scheduling patterns that do not align with typical operational behavior.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use cron jobs to schedule tasks for later execution, allowing them to maintain persistence without immediate detection. By embedding malicious commands within these scheduled tasks, adversaries can execute payloads at specified intervals or conditions, bypassing real-time monitoring mechanisms.

**Sample Commands:**
- Adversaries may replace the default crontab file with a customized one using:
  ```bash
  crontab /path/to/malicious/crontab
  ```
- Scripts might be added to cron directories such as `/etc/cron.d` or `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` by adversaries attempting persistence.

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Replace the default `crontab` file with a reference file containing malicious commands.
2. Add a script in all subfolders of cron job directories.
3. Directly place a script within `/etc/cron.d`.
4. Insert a script in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/`.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- The detection strategy assumes that normal operational activities involving cron jobs have been established as baselines, which may not account for all legitimate use cases.
- Some stealthy adversaries may modify existing cron jobs subtly to avoid detection.
- Limited visibility into encrypted or obfuscated cron configurations might bypass this detection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrators configuring scheduled maintenance tasks in `/etc/cron.d`.
- System updates or patches that adjust cron job schedules temporarily.
- Automation scripts run by DevOps teams to manage deployments and backups.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

This detection is critical as adversaries using cron jobs can establish persistent access and execute commands without direct interaction. This enables stealthy operations and complicates incident response, especially if used in conjunction with other evasion techniques.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

To validate this detection strategy, follow these steps to emulate adversarial use of cron jobs:

1. **Cron - Replace crontab with referenced file**
   ```bash
   echo "* * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/malicious_script.sh" > malicious_crontab
   crontab malicious_crontab
   ```

2. **Cron - Add script to all cron subfolders**
   Create a script and place it in each subdirectory under `/etc/cron.d` or other relevant paths:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /etc/cron.d/subfolder1 /etc/cron.d/subfolder2
   echo "* * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/malicious_script.sh" > /etc/cron.d/subfolder1/script.sh
   ```

3. **Cron - Add script to `/etc/cron.d` folder**
   ```bash
   echo "@daily /bin/bash /path/to/malicious_script.sh" >> /etc/cron.d/malicious_cronjob
   ```

4. **Cron - Add script to `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` folder**
   Create a crontab for a specific user:
   ```bash
   echo "* * * * * /bin/bash /path/to/malicious_script.sh" >> /var/spool/cron/crontabs/testuser
   ```

## Response

When an alert fires indicating potential malicious use of cron jobs, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Cross-reference with known operational baselines and investigate recent changes to crontab files or scripts.
2. **Containment:** Immediately isolate affected systems to prevent further execution of malicious tasks.
3. **Investigation:** Analyze the content and intent of suspicious cron job entries, reviewing associated scripts for harmful commands.
4. **Remediation:** Remove malicious cron jobs, restore configurations from a known good state, and patch any vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.
5. **Documentation & Reporting:** Document findings and update threat models to enhance future detection strategies.
