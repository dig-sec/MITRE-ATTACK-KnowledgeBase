# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using TFTP Boot

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms using the TFTP Boot method. This detection aims to identify unauthorized or suspicious activities where adversaries attempt to leverage the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) for booting systems, often as a means to evade detection and maintain persistence within a network.

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Network

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring network traffic for indicators associated with TFTP Boot activity. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic Logs**: Analysis of unusual or unauthorized TFTP requests, especially those originating from unexpected IP addresses or atypical times.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**: Monitoring systems for changes in boot configuration that might indicate TFTP use.

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Repeated TFTP traffic to the same external server, particularly during non-business hours.
- Modifications to system files related to boot processes that are not part of standard administrative updates.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may execute TFTP Boot by setting up a rogue TFTP server and configuring targets (typically vulnerable systems) to pull an unauthorized boot file. This method is often used in environments where PXE booting is enabled, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads during the boot process. 

### Adversary Emulation Details

Sample Commands:
- **Setting Up TFTP Server**: `tftpd -l /path/to/tftpboot -s`
- **Configuring a Victim Machine for Boot**:
  ```bash
  # On the target system, modify network settings to pull boot files from the attacker-controlled TFTP server.
  echo "next-server <TFTP_SERVER_IP>" >> /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
  echo "filename pxelinux.0" >> /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf
  ```

Test Scenarios:
- Simulate a rogue TFTP server setup within a controlled lab environment and observe the network traffic from selected endpoint systems.
- Attempt to modify boot configurations on vulnerable endpoints and analyze responses or changes detected by monitoring tools.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

Known Limitations:
- The strategy assumes that all significant TFTP traffic is captured by network monitors, which might not be true if traffic filtering is in place.
- It relies on the visibility of endpoint configuration changes, potentially missing unauthorized modifications executed with elevated privileges or through alternative methods.

Assumptions:
- Assumes baseline knowledge of normal TFTP usage patterns within the network to distinguish between legitimate and suspicious activities.
- Relies on timely updates to detection rules as adversaries evolve their techniques.

## False Positives

Potential benign triggers for false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of TFTP by IT departments for maintenance or deployment tasks, particularly during scheduled downtimes.
- Network boot processes configured in corporate environments where remote management and patching are common.

To mitigate false positives, it is crucial to incorporate contextual information such as user roles, timeframes, and historical usage patterns into the detection logic.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification:
- TFTP Boot can significantly compromise system integrity by allowing adversaries to execute arbitrary code during the boot process.
- It poses a substantial threat to enterprise environments where PXE booting is enabled, potentially leading to widespread lateral movement or data exfiltration if left undetected.

## Response

When an alert fires indicating potential TFTP Boot activity:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Quarantine affected systems from the network to prevent further spread of malicious payloads.
2. **Investigation**:
   - Examine logs for detailed traffic analysis between endpoints and the suspicious TFTP server.
   - Review endpoint configurations for unauthorized changes related to boot settings.
3. **Remediation**:
   - Revert any unauthorized modifications to system files or network settings.
   - Update firewall rules to block outbound connections to identified rogue TFTP servers.
4. **Reporting**: Document findings and communicate with relevant stakeholders, including security teams and affected departments.
