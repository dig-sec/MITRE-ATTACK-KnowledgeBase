# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting containers. Specifically, it focuses on identifying instances where attackers escape from containerized environments to the host system, thereby gaining elevated privileges.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1611 - Escape to Host
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, Containers  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages a combination of log analysis and behavioral patterns to identify suspicious activities indicative of container escape attempts. Key data sources include system logs from both host and container environments, network traffic logs, and audit trails. The strategy analyzes:

- Unusual process spawning within containers.
- Sudden changes in file permissions or ownership on the host filesystem.
- Unexpected network connections originating from containers.

Anomalies detected through these patterns are flagged as potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).

## Technical Context

Adversaries execute container escape by exploiting vulnerabilities within the container runtime environment, such as misconfigured Docker volumes or kernel-level exploits. Common methods include:

- **nsenter Container Escape:** Utilizing tools like `nsenter` to gain host namespace access.
- **Docker Volume Mapping:** Exploiting shared volume permissions to escalate privileges on the host.

### Adversary Emulation Details

Adversaries may use commands such as:
```bash
# Example of nsenter-based escape
docker run -it --rm <vulnerable-image> /bin/sh
nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may fail if the attacker leverages zero-day vulnerabilities not covered by existing monitoring.
  - Advanced attackers might use anti-detection techniques to obfuscate their actions.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The host system is properly configured with logging enabled for all relevant events.
  - Security teams regularly update and patch container runtimes and host systems.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative tasks involving elevated privileges within containers.
- Network traffic from containerized applications performing routine operations.
- Authorized changes to file permissions as part of application updates or maintenance.

## Priority

**Severity:** High  
**Justification:** Container escape can lead to full host compromise, granting attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code with system-level access. This presents a significant risk to both data integrity and confidentiality across environments.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

To validate this detection strategy in a test environment:

1. **Deploy a Vulnerable Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name vulnerable_container <vulnerable-image>
   ```

2. **Escape Using `nsenter`:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it vulnerable_container /bin/sh
   nsenter --target 1 --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid
   ```

3. **Mount Host Filesystem:**
   ```bash
   mkdir /mnt/host && mount -o bind / /mnt/host
   cd /mnt/host/path/to/privileged/files
   # Perform privilege escalation tasks
   ```

4. **Verify Privilege Escalation:**
   Use tools like `sudo` or `chmod` to change file permissions on the host.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

- Immediately isolate the affected container and host systems from the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of logs and system states to confirm the compromise.
- Identify and remediate the exploited vulnerability, updating configurations as necessary.
- Review access controls and privilege levels for containers and hosts to prevent future occurrences.
