# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: DLL Side-Loading (T1574.002)

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring and achieve unauthorized access using **DLL side-loading** on Windows platforms. This method involves loading malicious Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) instead of legitimate ones, often used by attackers for persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy for DLL side-loading involves monitoring and analyzing specific data sources and patterns:

1. **Data Sources:**
   - Process execution logs
   - System event logs (e.g., Windows Event Log)
   - File integrity monitoring systems

2. **Patterns Analyzed:**
   - Unexpected changes in the file path or location of DLLs.
   - Processes loading DLLs from non-standard directories.
   - Unusual command-line arguments during process creation that hint at side-loading techniques.

By leveraging these data sources and patterns, security systems can identify anomalies indicative of DLL side-loading activities.

## Technical Context
DLL side-loading occurs when a malicious actor replaces legitimate DLL files with their own or instructs the system to load malicious DLLs from an alternate location. This is commonly executed using various methods such as:

- **Environment Variable Manipulation:** Modifying `PATH` variables to prioritize paths containing malicious DLLs.
- **Command-Line Subversion:** Using command-line options like `/C`, which can influence how applications load libraries.
  
### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries often execute side-loading by:
1. Replacing or copying the legitimate DLL with a malicious version in an unexpected directory.
2. Modifying environment variables to prioritize these directories when searching for DLLs.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Difficulty in distinguishing between benign and malicious changes if similar naming conventions are used by both.
  - Some legitimate software might use non-standard paths for certain operations, leading to potential gaps in detection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The system's integrity monitoring is properly configured and up-to-date with known good states.
  - Event logs are comprehensive and retained long enough for correlation analysis.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software updates or installations that modify DLLs temporarily.
- Development environments where custom DLLs are used for testing purposes.
- Misconfigured applications that inadvertently load libraries from non-standard paths.

## Priority
**Severity Assessment:** High

Justification: DLL side-loading can lead to persistent and covert access by attackers, significantly compromising system integrity. The technique is favored for its stealthiness and effectiveness in evading traditional defenses.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy, the following steps can be used to emulate DLL side-loading in a controlled test environment:

1. **DLL Side-Loading using Notepad++ GUP.exe:**
   - Place a malicious `GUP.dll` in the current directory.
   - Execute `gup64.exe` from the same location.

2. **DLL Side-Loading using Dotnet Startup Hook Environment Variable:**
   - Set the environment variable `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` to point to a malicious DLL's path.
   - Run any dotnet application and observe the startup hook in action.

3. **DLL Search Order Hijacking, DLL Sideloading via KeyScramblerIE.DLL:**
   - Place `KeyScramblerIE.dll` in an uncommon directory, e.g., `%AppData%`.
   - Execute `KeyScrambler.exe`, configured to rely on the search order for its dependencies.

## Response
When a DLL side-loading alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network.
   - Conduct a thorough examination of all processes loaded with unexpected DLLs.

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Review recent changes in environment variables and PATH settings.
   - Analyze logs for any anomalies or patterns that match known side-loading techniques.
   - Verify file integrity using a trusted baseline or hash comparison.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore legitimate DLLs from a secure backup.
   - Reset any modified environment variables to their default state.
   - Update security monitoring rules and signatures based on findings.
