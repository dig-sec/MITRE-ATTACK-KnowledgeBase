# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containerization technologies. The focus is on identifying when adversaries exploit containers to obscure their activities and evade detection systems.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1586 - Compromise Accounts
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Execution)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring container activity to identify patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Host-level system events and process monitoring
- Network traffic associated with container communications

Patterns analyzed include unusual container image downloads or executions, abnormal resource usage, and network anomalies that suggest attempts to hide malicious activity within containers.

## Technical Context

Adversaries use containers to execute payloads while minimizing their footprint and avoiding detection. Containers allow for rapid deployment of applications in isolated environments, which can be leveraged by attackers to perform reconnaissance, maintain persistence, or exfiltrate data without being detected by traditional security tools.

### Adversary Emulation Details

- **Sample Commands:**
  - Creating a container with privileged access: `docker run --privileged <image>`
  - Modifying host network settings from within a container: `ip addr add <host_ip>/24 dev eth0`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a container that attempts to download and execute an external payload.
  - Monitor for unusual resource consumption patterns or unexpected outbound connections.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- Assumes monitoring systems are configured to collect detailed logs from container orchestrators and host systems.
- Relies on the ability to distinguish between legitimate and adversarial use of containers, which may not always be clear-cut.
- May miss detection if adversaries use sophisticated obfuscation techniques or leverage newly emerging container technologies.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate deployment of new applications in containers.
- Resource-intensive development or testing environments within containers.
- Network traffic from authorized data exfiltration tools used for legitimate purposes (e.g., backups).

## Priority

**Severity: High**

The use of containers by adversaries to bypass security monitoring is a significant threat due to the difficulty in detecting and responding to such activities. Containers provide a stealthy environment that can be exploited to maintain persistence, move laterally within networks, or exfiltrate sensitive data undetected.

## Response

When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Activity:** Confirm whether container activity aligns with known benign operations.
2. **Investigate Anomalies:** Examine logs for unusual patterns in resource usage, network traffic, and container behavior.
3. **Contain Threat:** If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate affected containers and hosts to prevent further compromise.
4. **Remediate Impact:** Remove any unauthorized containers or processes and restore systems to a secure state.
5. **Enhance Detection:** Update monitoring rules and signatures based on insights gained from the incident.
