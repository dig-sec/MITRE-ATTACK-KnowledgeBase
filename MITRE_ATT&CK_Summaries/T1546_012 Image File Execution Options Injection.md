## Strategy Abstract
This strategy employs a combination of event log monitoring and process tracking to detect anomalies in the Image File Execution Options (IFEO). Key data sources include Windows Event Logs, particularly focusing on Event ID 4688 which indicates changes made by processes. The strategy analyzes patterns such as unexpected entries added to the HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options registry key.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit Image File Execution Options to inject malicious code into processes during their execution, often to maintain persistence or escalate privileges without direct detection. They may use tools like `reg.exe` to modify registry settings under the HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options key, thereby executing malicious payloads when certain applications are launched.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Command:** 
  ```shell
  reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d "C:\malicious\payload.exe" /f
  ```
- **Test Scenario:**
  - Modify registry to associate a debugger with a benign application like `notepad.exe`.
  - Launch the associated application and monitor for unexpected execution of the payload.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** Detection may not cover indirect methods used by advanced adversaries, such as obfuscating the injected paths or using legitimate software updates to inject code.
- **Assumption:** The detection assumes registry changes will be logged correctly in event logs, which might not always occur if logging is tampered with.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate debugging processes added by developers for troubleshooting purposes.
- Software installation or updates modifying IFEO entries to enforce code signing checks.

## Priority
**High:** The technique allows adversaries significant stealth and persistence capabilities, often bypassing traditional security mechanisms. Its detection is crucial in environments with high-risk profiles or sensitive data.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a controlled test environment:

1. **IFEO Add Debugger**
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
   - Execute: 
     ```shell
     reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d "C:\test\payload.exe" /f
     ```
   - Attempt to open Notepad and observe any unusual process behavior.

2. **IFEO Global Flags**
   - Modify global flags in registry:
     ```shell
     reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\GlobalFlags" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d "/p /c C:\test\payload.exe" /f
     ```
   - Launch any application and monitor execution paths.

3. **GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options**
   - Test impact by setting global flags:
     ```shell
     reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options" /v GlobalFlags /t REG_DWORD /d 0x20000 /f
     ```
   - Launch a process and observe if the payload is executed.

## Response
Upon detecting an alert:
1. **Verify Event Logs:** Confirm changes in IFEO entries using Windows Event Viewer, focusing on Event ID 4688.
2. **Containment:** Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further propagation of malicious code.
3. **Investigation:**
   - Identify all processes leveraging modified IFEO entries.
   - Assess whether any legitimate applications are unintentionally executing payloads.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove unauthorized registry changes and restore original settings.
   - Apply necessary patches or updates to address vulnerabilities exploited by the adversary.
