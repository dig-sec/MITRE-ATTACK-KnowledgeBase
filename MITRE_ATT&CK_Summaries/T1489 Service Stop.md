# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring by Stopping Services

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify and mitigate adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by stopping critical services on target systems across Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1489 - Service Stop
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Impact
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS

For more information, see the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489).

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying malicious activities associated with stopping critical services to evade security monitoring. The approach leverages a combination of log analysis and event correlation across multiple data sources including:

- **Windows Event Logs**: Analyzing Service Control Manager events (Event IDs 7045, 7036) for service stop actions.
- **Syslog Entries** on Linux: Monitoring `systemd` logs for stopped services using the `journalctl` utility.
- **macOS System Logs**: Tracking changes in process activities and system log files for service termination.

The strategy includes pattern analysis to differentiate between legitimate administrative tasks and potential adversarial behavior, such as repeated or suspicious timing of service stop events.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often execute the T1489 technique by leveraging native commands on target systems to terminate critical services that monitor security infrastructure. This can be done using various methods depending on the platform:

- **Windows**: Adversaries may use `sc.exe`, `net.exe`, or directly kill processes via Task Manager or command-line tools.
- **Linux**: Commands like `systemctl stop <service>`, `killall <process-name>`, and `pkill -f <pattern>` are commonly used.
- **macOS**: Similar to Linux, adversaries may use `launchctl` or direct process termination commands.

**Adversary Emulation Example:**
On Windows, stopping a service using `sc.exe` can be emulated with the command:
```shell
sc stop "TargetService"
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots**: 
  - Detection may not cover all methods if custom scripts or uncommon tools are used by adversaries.
  - Covert service stopping techniques that evade logging mechanisms.
  
- **Assumptions**:
  - Critical services have been pre-defined based on organizational security policies.
  - Event logs and system monitoring tools are fully operational and configured to capture relevant events.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:

- Legitimate administrative actions where IT personnel stop services for maintenance or updates.
- Scheduled tasks that automatically stop certain services as part of their routine operations.
- Software applications performing clean-up routines which may involve stopping services temporarily.

## Priority
**High**: Stopping critical security monitoring services can lead to significant blind spots, allowing further adversarial activities to go undetected. The potential impact on organizational security posture justifies a high priority for this detection strategy.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate the effectiveness of this detection strategy, perform the following adversary emulation steps in a controlled test environment:

### Windows
1. **Stop service using Service Controller**:
   ```shell
   sc stop "TargetService"
   ```

2. **Stop service using net.exe**:
   ```shell
   net stop "TargetService"
   ```

3. **Stop service by killing process**:
   - Identify the process ID (PID) of the service and use `taskkill`:
     ```shell
     tasklist /svc | findstr "TargetService"
     taskkill /f /im <process_name>.exe
     ```

### Linux
1. **Stop service using systemctl**:
   ```shell
   sudo systemctl stop target-service.service
   ```

2. **Stop service by killing process using killall**:
   ```shell
   sudo killall -9 target-process-name
   ```

3. **Stop service by killing process using kill**:
   - Identify the PID and use `kill`:
     ```shell
     ps aux | grep target-process-name
     sudo kill -9 <PID>
     ```

4. **Stop service by killing process using pkill**:
   ```shell
   sudo pkill -f target-pattern
   ```

### macOS
- Use similar techniques as Linux with `launchctl` or direct process termination commands.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert**: Confirm whether a legitimate administrative action caused the service stop.
2. **Investigate Context**: Examine related logs and system events for suspicious activities around the time of the incident.
3. **Assess Impact**: Determine if any critical security monitoring capabilities were compromised.
4. **Containment**: If malicious activity is confirmed, take steps to restore services immediately and isolate affected systems.
5. **Remediation**: Review and enhance access controls and service management policies to prevent recurrence.
