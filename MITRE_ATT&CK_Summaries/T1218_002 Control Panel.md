# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting container technologies on Windows systems. This involves identifying when adversaries use containers as a means to evade detection mechanisms and execute malicious activities unnoticed.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1218.002 - Control Panel  
  - **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion  
  - **Platforms:** Windows  

For more information on MITRE ATT&CK reference, see [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/002).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activity and configuration changes that could indicate adversarial actions. Data sources include:
- Event logs from Windows systems, especially those related to process creation, registry modifications, and security policy changes.
- Network traffic associated with container orchestration platforms such as Docker or Kubernetes.

Patterns analyzed include unexpected or unauthorized access to control panel settings, alterations in container configurations, and communication between containers that deviate from normal patterns. Alerts are triggered based on anomalies like the spawning of new processes within containers that have not been whitelisted or changes in network policies.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often leverage containers due to their lightweight nature and ease of deployment, which can be used to obscure malicious activities. By running malware within containers, they aim to bypass traditional endpoint detection systems that may not inspect containerized processes as rigorously.

Real-world execution involves adversaries using tools like Docker or Kubernetes to deploy and manage containers that host malicious payloads. This can include:
- Executing commands such as `docker run -d --name <container_name> <image>` for deploying containers with malicious intent.
- Using orchestration scripts to automate the deployment of multiple containers designed to perform coordinated attacks.

Adversary emulation might involve setting up a test environment using Docker on Windows, then executing similar commands while monitoring system logs and network traffic to observe potential evasion techniques.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:
- Detection may not cover all types of container management tools.
- The assumption that all container activities are potentially malicious could lead to missing legitimate use cases.
- Limited visibility into highly obfuscated or encrypted container communications.

Assumptions made in this strategy include the presence of comprehensive logging mechanisms on Windows systems and the ability to correlate events across different data sources effectively.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate development environments where developers frequently build and deploy containers.
- Automated scripts for routine maintenance or updates that involve container manipulations.
- Misconfigurations in security policies leading to false identifications of normal operations as malicious.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to evade detection through containers poses a significant risk, particularly in environments where containerization is prevalent. Given the potential impact on organizational security and data integrity, it is crucial to prioritize monitoring and detecting such evasion techniques.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install Docker on a Windows machine.
   - Configure necessary permissions for container management.

2. **Deploy Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name test_container ubuntu sleep 3600
   ```

3. **Simulate Malicious Activity:**
   - Attempt to modify control panel settings from within the container (if applicable).
   - Execute commands that mimic malicious behavior, such as network scanning or unauthorized data access.

4. **Monitor Logs and Network Traffic:**
   - Use tools like Wireshark to capture network traffic.
   - Analyze Windows event logs for unusual activities related to container operations.

5. **Evaluate Alerts:**
   - Check if the detection strategy successfully identifies these actions without significant false positives.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected systems and containers to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of logged events and network traffic associated with the alert.
- Review container configurations and recent changes for any signs of tampering or unauthorized modifications.
- Update security policies and whitelists as necessary to prevent future incidents.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently not available. Analysts should consider consulting Docker and Kubernetes documentation for further insights into legitimate vs. malicious activities within containers.
