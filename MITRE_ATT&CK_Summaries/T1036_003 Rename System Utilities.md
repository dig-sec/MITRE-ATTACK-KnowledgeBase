# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Mitigating Process Masquerading in Windows and Unix-based Systems

## **Goal**
The goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts at bypassing security monitoring by masquerading malicious processes as legitimate system utilities across different operating systems.

## **Categorization**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** 
  - T1036.003 - Rename System Utilities
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/003)

## **Strategy Abstract**
The detection strategy involves monitoring for anomalies in process behaviors and attributes across various data sources such as system logs, process listings, and file integrity checks. Patterns analyzed include unexpected changes in process names, discrepancies between executable paths and their expected locations, and processes executing with elevated privileges without corresponding authorization.

Key data sources:
- Process execution logs
- Filesystem access records
- System event logs

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries employ the T1036.003 technique to evade detection by renaming malicious executables as trusted system utilities. This can involve altering process names in memory, changing file extensions or executable names on disk, and leveraging legitimate processes' execution paths.

In practice:
- Windows adversaries might rename `cscript.exe` to `notepad.exe`.
- Unix-based systems may see binaries like `/bin/bash` renamed to `/usr/sbin/crond`.

Adversaries often use scripts or manual commands to achieve this. For example, in Windows PowerShell, an attacker might execute a command like:
```powershell
Rename-Item -Path "C:\Windows\System32\cscript.exe" -NewName "notepad.exe"
```

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- Detection may not cover all masquerading techniques, especially those involving sophisticated in-memory manipulations.
- Assumes that system logs are comprehensive and accurately configured.
- Relies on baseline knowledge of normal process behavior and naming conventions.

## **False Positives**
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate software updates or reconfigurations renaming utilities for compatibility reasons.
- System administrators performing maintenance tasks, such as backing up executables with altered names.

## **Priority**
**Severity: High**

Justification:
- Masquerading can significantly undermine detection capabilities and lead to deeper system compromise if not promptly identified.
- Commonly used by sophisticated threat actors aiming for prolonged access and data exfiltration.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**
To validate the strategy, perform the following emulation steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Masquerading as Windows LSASS process:**
   - Rename `lsass.exe` to another common process name like `explorer.exe`.

2. **Masquerading as FreeBSD or Linux crond process:**
   - Alter `/usr/sbin/crond` permissions and rename it to `/bin/bash`.

3. **Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe:**
   ```powershell
   Move-Item "C:\Windows\System32\cscript.exe" "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"
   ```

4. **Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe:**
   ```cmd
   ren C:\Windows\SysWOW64\wscript.exe C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
   ```

5. **Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe:**
   ```powershell
   Move-Item "C:\Windows\System32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe" "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\taskhostw.exe"
   ```

6. **Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe:**
   - Copy a Linux binary and rename it to mimic a Windows system utility.

7. **Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe:**
   ```cmd
   ren C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe
   ```

8. **Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe:**
   - Create a fake `LSM.exe` to impersonate legitimate system management tasks.

## **Response**
When an alert indicating potential masquerading is triggered, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected systems from the network.
- Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the suspicious processes.
- Review recent changes in process names and paths using logs.
- Verify integrity of critical system files and directories.
- Update detection rules based on findings to enhance future responses.

## **Additional Resources**
For further context, consider exploring:
- Logs indicating file modifications within system directories.
- Alerts related to unusual command-line executions or privilege escalations.
- Incident reports highlighting similar attack vectors in recent security breaches.

This report provides a comprehensive approach to detecting and responding to process masquerading activities as part of an effective ADS framework.
