# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that utilize containers as a means to bypass security monitoring mechanisms across diverse environments.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves leveraging telemetry data from various sources such as container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker), host-level logs, and network traffic analysis. Key patterns analyzed include anomalous process creation within containers, unexpected privilege escalations, and suspicious inter-container communication that deviates from established baselines.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit the isolated nature of containers to execute malicious activities without being detected by traditional security tools. Common methods include:

- **Process Injection:** Running malicious processes inside a container while masking their origins.
- **Resource Misuse:** Leveraging legitimate container images and configurations to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.
  
Example adversary emulation involves creating a benign container that mimics unusual behaviors such as unexpected network connections or file modifications, allowing the testing of detection mechanisms.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may fail if containers are deployed in highly ephemeral environments where logs are not retained.
  - Obfuscation techniques used by advanced adversaries could hinder signature-based detections.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Container runtime logs are available and properly configured to capture relevant events.
  - A baseline of normal container activity exists for anomaly detection comparisons.

## False Positives
Potential false positives may arise from:

- Legitimate administrative activities involving containers, such as automated updates or deployments.
- Misconfigured containers that exhibit abnormal behaviors without malicious intent.

## Priority
**Priority Level: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used in modern IT infrastructures, making them attractive vectors for adversaries. The ability to bypass security controls poses a significant risk, necessitating robust detection strategies.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no step-by-step instructions are available for emulating this technique. Future work should focus on developing comprehensive test scenarios that simulate real-world adversarial behaviors in containerized environments.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected container and associated network segments.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the nature of the activity.

- **Follow-up Steps:**
  - Review access controls and ensure they are appropriately configured.
  - Analyze logs for patterns that might indicate broader compromise.
  - Update detection rules based on findings to improve future response capabilities.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context are available. It is recommended to consult with container security experts and leverage community forums for the latest insights and best practices in container threat detection.
