# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Group Policy Discovery on Windows Platforms

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to discover and potentially misuse group policy settings on Windows platforms as part of their efforts to bypass security monitoring or gain unauthorized privileges.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1615 - Group Policy Discovery
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing log data for unauthorized or suspicious use of commands related to group policy discovery. Key data sources include Security Event Logs (Event ID 4624), PowerShell logs, and specific Sysmon events that capture command line usage indicative of T1615 activity.

Patterns analyzed involve the execution of commands like `gpresult`, PowerShell's `Get-DomainGPO`, or third-party tools such as WinPwn. Anomalous access patterns by non-administrative users attempting these actions are flagged, along with unexpected geolocations and time-of-day activities that deviate from baseline behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use group policy discovery to understand an organization's security configuration, helping them identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. In real-world scenarios, adversaries might use legitimate commands such as `gpresult` on a command line interface or PowerShell scripts like `Get-DomainGPO` from PowerView to extract this information.

These actions are often part of the broader reconnaissance phase in an attack lifecycle, where attackers seek detailed insight into system configurations and policies. Tools like WinPwn can automate these processes, gathering comprehensive details across domains swiftly.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection might miss encrypted or obfuscated command executions.
  - May not catch activities that occur only during authorized administrative maintenance windows.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes baseline behavior patterns are well-defined for users with legitimate access to group policy tools.
  - Relies on timely log updates and accurate event correlation.

## False Positives
- Administrators performing routine audits or troubleshooting using these commands might trigger alerts.
- Legitimate automated scripts that include these commands as part of their functionality may also be flagged erroneously.
  
## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the technique itself is not inherently malicious, its misuse can facilitate deeper access to sensitive systems. Therefore, timely detection and analysis are crucial to prevent further exploitation but do not require emergency prioritization.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate the detection strategy in a controlled test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Using `gpresult`:**
   - Execute `gpresult /h C:\temp\gpresult.html` on a Windows system to generate group policy reports.
   
2. **PowerView's `Get-DomainGPO`:**
   - Load PowerView and run `Get-DomainGPO` in PowerShell to list all Group Policies in the domain.

3. **WinPwn - GPOAudit:**
   - Run `WinPwn.exe -gpoaudit` to audit group policies within a network.
   
4. **WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy:**
   - Use `WinPwn.exe -gporap` to enumerate Remote Access Policies.

5. **MSFT Get-GPO Cmdlet:**
   - Execute `Get-GPO -All` in PowerShell using the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) module.

## Response
Upon detection of an alert:

- Immediately review logs to confirm command execution origin and context.
- Validate if the activity aligns with known administrative tasks or scheduled maintenance.
- If unauthorized, escalate to security operations for further investigation.
- Temporarily restrict affected user accounts or systems pending resolution.
- Enhance monitoring on related assets and update behavioral baselines.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently unavailable. It is advisable to consult internal IT documentation and maintain up-to-date knowledge of organizational policies regarding the use of group policy management tools.
