# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution (T1127)

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using trusted developer utilities for proxy execution, specifically focusing on techniques that leverage `Jsc.exe`—a legitimate Windows utility—to execute arbitrary scripts or code. This often falls under the tactic of Defense Evasion.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring for anomalous behaviors associated with trusted developer utilities like `Jsc.exe`. This includes analyzing process execution logs, network traffic patterns, and file system changes. Key indicators include unusual command-line arguments passed to these utilities, unexpected invocation patterns (e.g., during non-working hours), and the generation of executable files from scripts in locations typically used by legitimate development processes.

Data sources utilized include:
- Process monitoring
- File integrity checks
- Network traffic analysis

Patterns analyzed focus on deviations from established baselines for normal developer activity, such as:
- Execution of `Jsc.exe` with unusual or complex arguments
- Creation of executables or DLLs in non-standard directories
- Uncharacteristic usage patterns that suggest automated or scripted use rather than manual development tasks

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit trusted developer utilities like `Jsc.exe` to execute malicious code while evading detection. These utilities are often overlooked by traditional security solutions due to their legitimate nature and typical association with benign software development activities.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries might:
- Use scripts that embed malicious payloads compiled via `Jsc.exe`
- Exploit trust in these utilities to download or communicate with C2 servers covertly

### Adversary Emulation Details
Sample commands used for emulation include:
- Compiling a JavaScript payload into an executable using `Jsc.exe`:

  ```shell
  jsc.exe /nologo <script.js> -out:<output.exe>
  ```

- Compiling a JavaScript payload into a DLL file:

  ```shell
  jsc.exe /nologo <script.js> -dll:<output.dll>
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes a baseline of normal developer activity; deviations may be subtle.
- Potential blind spots include environments where `Jsc.exe` is commonly used for legitimate purposes, leading to higher noise levels in alerts.
- The strategy assumes that unusual usage patterns are indicative of malicious intent, which may not always be the case.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software development tasks involving frequent use of `Jsc.exe`
- Automated build or deployment scripts using trusted utilities as part of standard operations

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
**Justification:** The ability to bypass security controls by leveraging trusted developer tools poses a significant risk, enabling adversaries to execute malicious code with reduced detection likelihood. The impact can be severe if such techniques are used in conjunction with other advanced threat tactics.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Set up a controlled Windows environment** where `Jsc.exe` is accessible.
2. **Write a benign JavaScript payload**: Create a simple script that performs harmless actions, such as logging to a file or displaying a message.

   ```javascript
   // example.js
   WScript.Echo("This is a test script.");
   ```

3. **Compile the script using `Jsc.exe`**:
   
   - To compile to an executable:

     ```shell
     jsc.exe /nologo example.js -out:example.exe
     ```

   - To compile to a DLL:

     ```shell
     jsc.exe /nologo example.js -dll:example.dll
     ```

4. **Monitor for execution and file creation** using process monitoring tools, ensuring alerts are triggered by these actions.

## Response
When an alert related to this technique is detected:
- Immediately investigate the context of `Jsc.exe` usage.
- Verify whether the activity aligns with known development schedules or tasks.
- Examine network traffic for any suspicious outbound connections that might indicate C2 communication.
- Isolate affected systems and conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine if malicious payloads were executed.
