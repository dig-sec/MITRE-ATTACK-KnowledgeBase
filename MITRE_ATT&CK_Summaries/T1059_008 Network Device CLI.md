# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Adversarial Container Bypass in Security Monitoring

---

## Goal
The goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using containers. This technique often involves adversaries leveraging containerization technology to obscure malicious activity, making detection by traditional network and endpoint security solutions more challenging.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous activities associated with container usage that might indicate attempts to bypass security monitoring. Key data sources include:

- **Container Orchestrator Logs:** Analyzing logs from orchestrators like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for unusual patterns in scheduling, resource allocation, or network configurations.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring for unusual network traffic patterns between containers and external networks.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Observing unexpected changes to container image manifests or configuration files.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual spikes in CPU/memory usage of specific containers
- Containers communicating with known malicious IP addresses or domains
- Changes in default port configurations
- Use of privileged mode without explicit justification

## Technical Context

Adversaries may use containers for several purposes, including deploying malware, exfiltrating data, or establishing command and control channels. In the real world, this might involve:

- **Compromising Container Images:** Inserting malicious code into container images that are then deployed across a network.
- **Network Isolation Bypass:** Using inter-container communication to bypass network isolation measures.

Adversary emulation scenarios could include creating and deploying a custom container image with known vulnerabilities or using tools like `kubectl` to execute commands within containers without proper authorization.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Dynamic Environments:** Highly dynamic environments might result in false positives due to legitimate spikes in resource usage.
- **Legitimate Container Usage:** High levels of containerization for valid business purposes could be misinterpreted as malicious.
- **Sophisticated Adversaries:** Advanced techniques that mask activities within legitimate-looking containers may bypass detection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities include:

- Legitimate high-resource applications deployed in containers
- Network testing tools used during development phases
- Scheduled maintenance tasks involving temporary changes to container configurations

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification:
The ability of adversaries to use containers for evasion poses a significant threat, especially as organizations increasingly adopt containerization. Detection is critical to maintaining robust security postures and preventing lateral movement within networks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster in a controlled environment.
   - Ensure all nodes are monitored with the detection strategy in place.

2. **Deploy Malicious Container Image:**
   - Create a container image containing a known payload or tool (e.g., netcat for command and control).
   - Push this image to a private Docker registry accessible by the cluster.

3. **Execute Adversarial Actions:**
   - Use `kubectl` commands to deploy the malicious container.
   - Configure the container to attempt connections to an external IP address mimicking a C2 server.

4. **Observe and Analyze Alerts:**
   - Monitor for alerts triggered by unusual network traffic or changes in resource allocation.
   - Validate that alerts correlate with the adversary emulation scenario.

## Response

When an alert is fired:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quiesce or isolate containers involved to prevent further potential impact.
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Capture container logs and network traffic for detailed analysis.
   - Investigate changes in resource usage patterns associated with the suspicious activity.
3. **Incident Reporting:** Document findings and escalate according to organizational incident response protocols.
4. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Remove malicious containers and images from the environment.
   - Review and tighten container deployment policies.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional resources or references are available for this strategy. However, ongoing research into emerging threats associated with containerization is recommended to continually refine detection capabilities.
