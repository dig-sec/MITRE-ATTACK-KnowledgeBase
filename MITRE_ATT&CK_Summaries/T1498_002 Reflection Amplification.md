# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Reflection Amplification (T1498.002)

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that utilize reflection amplification techniques to bypass security monitoring mechanisms across diverse platforms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1498.002 - Reflection Amplification
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Impact
- **Platforms:** Windows, Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Google Workspace
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/002)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis and endpoint monitoring to identify patterns consistent with reflection amplification attacks. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic Logs:** To monitor for unusual spikes in outbound traffic indicative of amplification attempts.
- **DNS Query Logs:** To detect abnormally high volumes or patterns of DNS requests that could suggest reflection techniques.
- **Endpoint Security Tools:** To capture any indicators of compromise on individual systems, particularly those running Windows, Linux, macOS, and cloud-based platforms like Azure AD.

The strategy analyzes for:
- Unusual amplification ratios in network traffic.
- Large numbers of outbound requests from a single source to various DNS servers.
- Consistent patterns across endpoints indicating coordinated reflection attacks.

## Technical Context

Adversaries execute reflection amplification by sending small queries with the target's IP address as the return address, prompting large responses from vulnerable services. This can overwhelm the target system, disrupting operations or masking other malicious activities. Common tools and protocols involved include DNS (Domain Name System) amplification, NTP (Network Time Protocol), and SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol).

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Utilizing `dig` with a spoofed IP to perform DNS amplification.
  - Example: `dig @<target-dns-server> any <vulnerable-dns-domain>.com +short -p<port>`
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Simulate large volumes of outbound requests from multiple internal systems, targeting known vulnerable public services.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Limitations:** 
  - The strategy may not detect reflection amplification originating from encrypted traffic channels.
  - Detection accuracy can be affected by legitimate spikes in network traffic or DNS queries due to application needs (e.g., CDN usage).
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes the presence of comprehensive logging across all relevant data sources.
  - Relies on established baselines for normal activity patterns.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate large-scale DNS queries from applications like CDNs or global services.
- Network configuration changes causing temporary spikes in traffic.
- Maintenance activities involving mass software updates or patches across numerous endpoints.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
**Justification:** Reflection amplification can severely impact network availability and disrupt business operations. Its ability to act as a precursor for more covert attacks makes it imperative to detect and mitigate promptly.

## Response

Upon detection, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the observed traffic patterns through cross-referencing with known baselines.
2. **Containment Actions:**
   - Temporarily block outgoing requests from suspicious IP addresses or domains at the network perimeter.
3. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze affected systems for signs of compromise or configuration issues that could facilitate reflection attacks.
4. **Remediation and Recovery:**
   - Adjust firewall rules to prevent future amplification attempts and ensure DNS servers are properly secured against such exploits.

## Additional Resources

Currently, there are no specific additional resources available for this technique beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework documentation. Organizations should refer to their vendor-specific security tool documentation for detailed guidance on configuring detection mechanisms tailored to reflection amplification threats.
