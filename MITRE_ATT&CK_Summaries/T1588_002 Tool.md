# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This includes identifying unauthorized container usage that may be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, command and control, or other stealthy operations.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1588.002 - Tool
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Environment)
  - [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages log data from container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and OpenShift. It analyzes patterns in container deployment, execution, and lifecycle management to identify suspicious activities indicative of an adversary's attempt to use containers for malicious purposes.

Key data sources include:
- Container runtime logs (e.g., Docker daemon logs)
- Orchestrator logs (e.g., Kubernetes API server logs)
- Network traffic logs associated with container communication

Patterns analyzed involve anomalies in resource allocation, unexpected network connections originating from containers, and unusual scheduling patterns that deviate from normal operations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers due to their lightweight nature, ease of deployment, and the potential for rapid scaling. In real-world scenarios, adversaries might use legitimate management tools with elevated privileges to deploy malicious containers without detection. Techniques such as using custom or obfuscated container images, running containers on privileged hosts, or establishing covert network communications can be observed.

Adversary emulation details:
- Deploying a container with elevated permissions
- Using known benign containers but altering their behavior (e.g., adding backdoor functionality)

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes the security monitoring system has visibility into all container orchestration platforms.
- May not detect highly sophisticated obfuscation techniques where adversaries mimic legitimate traffic patterns.
- Assumes that baselines for normal activity are well-established, which may not be the case in dynamic environments.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate high-frequency deployments during development or testing phases.
- Use of containers by IT teams for maintenance tasks such as backups or software updates.
- Network traffic from containers used for legitimate inter-service communication that mimics malicious patterns.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers can significantly undermine an organization's security posture. Containers are increasingly being adopted in various environments, making them a high-value target for adversaries aiming to evade detection while executing their operations.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Set Up Container Environment:**
   - Deploy a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes.
   - Configure logging and monitoring tools to capture relevant data streams.

2. **Deploy Malicious Container:**
   - Create or obtain an obfuscated image that simulates malicious behavior (e.g., establishing external connections).
   - Use elevated permissions to deploy the container on a test host within the orchestrated environment.

3. **Simulate Adversarial Actions:**
   - Execute commands within the container to mimic adversarial activities, such as data exfiltration attempts or unauthorized network communication.
   - Ensure the activity is recorded in logs for analysis.

4. **Analyze and Detect:**
   - Review generated logs using detection tools configured with patterns identified in the strategy abstract.
   - Validate that suspicious activities are flagged by the monitoring system.

## Response
Guidelines for analysts when the alert fires:
- Immediately isolate affected containers to prevent further unauthorized activity or data loss.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the container's deployment and execution history, including any associated user accounts and permissions.
- Review network traffic logs for unusual connections initiated by the flagged container.
- Collaborate with development teams to verify if the activity aligns with legitimate operations, adjusting detection rules as necessary.

This strategy provides a structured approach to detecting adversaries using containers to bypass security monitoring. Regular updates and refinements are recommended to adapt to evolving adversary tactics and technological advancements in containerized environments.
