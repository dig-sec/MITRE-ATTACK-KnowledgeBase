# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by using containers. The focus is on identifying how adversaries configure client environments within containerized workloads to evade detection.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1592.004 - Client Configurations
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Reference)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/004)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources, including container runtime logs, host system event logs, and network traffic analysis. Patterns are analyzed to identify anomalies in client configuration within containers that may indicate an attempt to evade security monitoring.

Key patterns include:
- Unusual configurations or settings applied to container environments.
- Discrepancies between standard operational baselines and observed configurations.
- Attempts to modify or disable logging and monitoring tools within the container.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to create isolated environments that can be configured to evade traditional security measures. This evasion typically involves:
- Altering runtime parameters to prevent detection by host-level security solutions.
- Configuring network settings to avoid sending traffic through monitored paths.
- Disabling or redirecting logging mechanisms within the container.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In a real-world scenario, adversaries might use commands like `docker run` with custom flags that alter networking or volume configurations. Test scenarios could involve setting up containers with modified log directories or network modes that bypass host-based monitoring tools.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** The baseline configuration for containerized environments is well-defined and maintained.
- **Blind Spot:** New evasion techniques not yet documented in the MITRE ATT&CK framework may go undetected.
- **Limitation:** Detection effectiveness relies on comprehensive logging and monitoring of both host and container activities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate configuration changes for performance tuning or resource optimization.
- Development and testing environments where non-standard configurations are intentional.
- Misconfigured containers due to human error rather than adversarial intent.

## Priority
**Priority Level: Medium**

Justification: While not as immediate a threat as other tactics, the ability of adversaries to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant risk. It allows them to operate undetected within an organizationâ€™s infrastructure, potentially leading to more severe breaches if left unchecked.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no publicly available step-by-step instructions for adversary emulation specific to this technique. However, potential steps could include:
1. Setting up a container environment with intentional configuration deviations.
2. Testing logging and monitoring tool detection within the container.
3. Attempting network isolation techniques to prevent traffic analysis.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential evasion attempts via containers is triggered:
- Immediately isolate the affected container instances for further investigation.
- Review recent changes in container configurations and compare against known baselines.
- Conduct a thorough audit of logging and monitoring setups within the affected environments.
- Engage with security teams to assess whether similar patterns exist across other parts of the infrastructure.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available beyond those referenced in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Organizations should consider developing internal documentation and playbooks specific to their container deployment strategies and monitoring capabilities.
