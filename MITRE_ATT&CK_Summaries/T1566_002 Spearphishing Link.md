# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using container technologies. This includes identifying adversaries who leverage containers for obfuscation, privilege escalation, or lateral movement within an environment.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1566.002 - Spearphishing Link
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Initial Access
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Office 365, SaaS, Google Workspace
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container-related activities across various platforms to identify malicious patterns. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- System and application event logs
- Network traffic data

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual image pulls from non-standard repositories
- Unexpected changes in container configurations or runtime parameters
- Anomalous network activity originating from containers
- Suspicious container scheduling or orchestration commands

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit container technologies to evade detection by leveraging their inherent isolation and dynamic nature. They may use containers to execute malicious payloads, maintain persistence, or perform lateral movement without triggering traditional security mechanisms.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Command Examples:** 
  - Using `kubectl exec` to inject shellcode into running containers.
  - Modifying Docker container configurations via `docker run --privileged`.
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a malicious container image from an unauthorized repository.
  - Execute commands within a container that modify system files or network settings.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss highly customized or novel container-based techniques not covered by existing patterns.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that adversaries are using common tools and practices associated with container exploitation, which might not always be the case.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of containers for testing or development purposes.
- Authorized administrative activities involving container management and configuration changes.

## Priority
**Priority: High**
Justification: The increasing adoption of container technologies in enterprise environments makes this a significant vector for adversaries. Early detection is crucial to prevent potential breaches and maintain security posture.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Setup Environment:** Deploy a Kubernetes cluster or Docker Swarm.
2. **Deploy Malicious Container:**
   - Pull an image from an unauthorized repository:
     ```bash
     kubectl run bad-container --image=malicious/repo/image
     ```
3. **Execute Commands:**
   - Use `kubectl exec` to inject shellcode:
     ```bash
     kubectl exec bad-container -- /bin/sh -c "echo 'Shellcode' > /tmp/malicious"
     ```
4. **Monitor Logs and Alerts:** Check for alerts triggered by the above activities.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm if the container activity is legitimate or malicious.
2. **Contain the Threat:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further damage.
3. **Investigate:** Analyze logs and network traffic to understand the scope of the attack.
4. **Remediate:** Remove malicious containers and patch any vulnerabilities exploited.
