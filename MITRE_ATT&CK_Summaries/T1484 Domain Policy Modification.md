# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using container technologies. Specifically, it focuses on identifying the unauthorized modification of domain policies within containerized environments that could facilitate evasion from traditional security controls.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1484 - Domain Policy Modification
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:**
  - Defense Evasion
  - Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows, Azure AD
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of log analysis and behavioral monitoring to detect unauthorized domain policy modifications. The approach focuses on analyzing logs from container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker) and Windows event logs, looking for patterns indicative of T1484 activity. Key indicators include unexpected changes in group policies applied within containers or anomalous modifications to Active Directory settings.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by deploying malicious containers that modify domain policies to gain elevated privileges or evade detection mechanisms. Common methods include:

- Using scripts within container images to alter Group Policy Objects (GPOs).
- Exploiting misconfigured permissions on the host system.
  
**Sample Commands:**
```bash
# Example of modifying GPO using PowerShell inside a container
powershell -Command "Set-GPRegistryValue -Name 'Default Domain Policy' -Key 'HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Control Panel\Desktop' -ValueName 'ScreenSaverIsSecure' -Type DWord -Value 1"
```

**Test Scenario:**
- Deploy a container with elevated privileges on a Windows host.
- Execute scripts that modify domain policies and observe log entries for unauthorized changes.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** 
  - Detection may not cover all types of policy modifications, particularly those obfuscated or conducted over extended periods.
  - The strategy assumes the presence of comprehensive logging mechanisms within both container platforms and host systems.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Adversaries require some level of access to deploy containers with sufficient privileges.
  - Logs are correctly configured to capture relevant domain policy changes.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative tasks involving GPO modifications for maintenance or updates.
- Misconfigured automated scripts within container deployments that inadvertently alter policies.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
- The ability of adversaries to modify domain policies can lead to significant privilege escalation and evasion from security controls, potentially compromising the entire environment.
- Detection is crucial for environments leveraging containers extensively, especially those integrated with Windows-based infrastructure.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
None available

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Integrity:** Confirm whether the domain policy changes were authorized by reviewing change logs and consulting relevant IT personnel.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers and systems to prevent further unauthorized modifications or escalation of privileges.
3. **Investigation:** Analyze logs to trace back the source of the modification, identifying potential entry points or compromised accounts.
4. **Remediation:** Revert unauthorized changes and enhance security controls to prevent recurrence, such as tightening access permissions and improving monitoring capabilities.
