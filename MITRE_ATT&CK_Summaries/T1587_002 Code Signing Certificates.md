# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Code Signing Certificates (T1587.002)

## Goal
The aim of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging compromised or unauthorized code signing certificates. This can allow attackers to distribute and execute malicious software that appears trustworthy.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring for unusual activities related to code signing certificates, which are crucial in establishing the authenticity and integrity of software. Key data sources include:

- **Certificate Management Systems:** To detect unauthorized issuance or modification of certificates.
- **Log Files from Software Deployment Tools:** For signs of maliciously signed applications being deployed.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** To identify suspicious patterns indicative of certificate misuse.

Patterns analyzed include abnormal changes in certificate properties, unexpected issuance to new entities, and anomalies in the deployment processes that could signal unauthorized signing activities.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may compromise code signing certificates through various methods such as phishing attacks aimed at developers or administrators responsible for managing these certificates. They might also exploit vulnerabilities within certificate management systems to issue fraudulent certificates. 

In real-world scenarios, adversaries execute this technique by:

- Stealing private keys associated with legitimate certificates.
- Using compromised accounts to request new certificates under their control.
- Exploiting software deployment pipelines to insert maliciously signed executables.

Adversary emulation might involve simulating certificate issuance requests from unauthorized sources or attempting to deploy applications with improperly signed certificates in a controlled environment to observe detection efficacy.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not cover all methods of obtaining or using compromised certificates, especially if adversaries use zero-day vulnerabilities.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that monitoring systems are correctly configured to capture relevant certificate-related events and anomalies.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate updates or changes in code signing processes by IT teams.
- Occasional misconfigurations in deployment tools leading to unexpected behavior.
- Routine administrative actions on certificates by authorized personnel.

## Priority
**High**

Justification: Compromised code signing can severely undermine trust in software distribution channels, enabling widespread distribution of malicious applications. Given the potential impact on organizational security and integrity, this technique is prioritized highly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

## Response

When an alert related to unauthorized certificate activity fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm whether the detected activity aligns with known benign processes or configurations.
2. **Investigate Anomalies:** Examine logs and network traffic for additional indicators of compromise.
3. **Containment:** If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.
4. **Remediation:** Revoke compromised certificates and investigate the source of compromise to prevent recurrence.
5. **Notify Stakeholders:** Inform relevant teams (e.g., security, IT operations) about the incident and coordinate a response.
