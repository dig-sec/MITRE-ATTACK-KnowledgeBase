# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containers to masquerade malicious activities as benign processes, specifically focusing on the manipulation of task or service names.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1036.004 - Masquerade Task or Service
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing specific data sources such as process creation events, service registration activities, and file system changes within container environments. Patterns analyzed include unusual task or service name similarities to legitimate system components (e.g., `W32Time`) and modifications of these entities using command-line tools like `schtasks` and `sc`. Additionally, the strategy involves detecting anomalies in process hiding techniques such as bind mounts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit container technologies for obfuscation by creating services or tasks that mimic legitimate system processes. In Windows environments, they might use `schtasks` or `sc` to create services resembling critical components like `W32Time`. On Linux systems, adversaries may employ `prctl` to rename process names within `/proc`, masking malicious activity.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Windows:** Use `schtasks /Create /SC DAILY /TN W32Time /TR cmd.exe` to create a task mimicking the Windows Time service.
- **Linux:** Execute `prctl(PR_SET_NAME, "W32Time", 0, 0, 0)` to rename a process.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Limited visibility into encrypted container traffic may obscure detection.
- Assumes that monitoring tools have full access to container environments and metadata.
- Relies on the assumption that anomaly patterns are well-defined and consistently identifiable across diverse systems.

## False Positives
- Legitimate updates or maintenance scripts creating similar-named services/tasks during scheduled times.
- Development teams deploying containers with internal naming conventions resembling system components for testing purposes.

## Priority
**High**: Given the potential impact of adversaries successfully masquerading malicious activities, this technique poses a significant threat to organizational security. The high priority is justified by its role in defense evasion and the critical nature of maintaining accurate monitoring integrity across environments.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate detection capabilities, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Windows: Creating W32Time Similar Named Service**
   - Use `schtasks`:
     ```bash
     schtasks /Create /SC DAILY /TN W32Time /TR cmd.exe
     ```
   - Verify with `schtasks /Query /FO LIST /V`.

2. **Windows: Using Sc to Create a Similar Named Service**
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     sc create W32Time binPath= "cmd.exe"
     ```
   - Confirm with `sc query W32Time`.

3. **Linux: Renaming /proc/pid/comm using Prctl**
   - Run the command within a container:
     ```c
     prctl(PR_SET_NAME, "W32Time", 0, 0, 0);
     ```

4. **Hiding a Malicious Process with Bind Mounts**
   - Set up bind mounts to obscure process directories and monitor for access anomalies.

## Response
When the alert fires:
- Immediately isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the processes and services involved.
- Review recent changes in container configurations or deployments.
- Implement stricter monitoring policies and update anomaly detection baselines accordingly.
