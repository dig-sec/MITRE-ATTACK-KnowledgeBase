# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Firmware-Based Reconnaissance Tactics

## Goal
The primary aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that use firmware manipulations during reconnaissance phases. This includes efforts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by exploiting vulnerabilities within firmware.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Pre-Exploitation)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy for firmware reconnaissance involves analyzing data from several key sources, including:

- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring traffic patterns to identify unusual requests or responses that may indicate probing of firmware components.
- **Endpoint Logs:** Reviewing system and application logs for anomalies in firmware operations or updates.
- **File Integrity Checks:** Observing changes to firmware files that could suggest unauthorized modifications or injections.

Patterns analyzed include unexpected firmware version changes, unapproved access attempts, and deviations from normal firmware communication patterns. By correlating these indicators across different data sources, the strategy aims to identify potential reconnaissance activities targeted at exploiting firmware vulnerabilities.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often execute firmware-based reconnaissance by probing systems for weak points in their pre-exploitation phase. This may involve:

- **Firmware Dumps:** Extracting firmware binaries from devices to analyze them offline.
- **Exploit Searches:** Looking for specific known vulnerabilities within the firmware that can be exploited later.

**Example Commands:**
```bash
# Example command to extract firmware image (hypothetical)
fw_extractor --device /dev/sda1 --output /tmp/firmware.img

# Command to search for common vulnerabilities in firmware binary
binwalk -e /tmp/firmware.img | grep "vulnerability_keyword"
```

**Test Scenarios:**
- Simulating unauthorized access attempts on firmware components.
- Observing system responses to abnormal firmware queries.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Limitations:** The strategy may not detect advanced persistent threats that use stealth techniques to obfuscate their activities within the firmware.
- **Assumptions:** It assumes that all devices have baseline security monitoring configured for firmware-related events, which might not always be the case in legacy systems.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate firmware updates initiated by system administrators.
- Routine diagnostics or self-checks performed by hardware components that inadvertently mimic reconnaissance behavior.

To mitigate false positives, it's crucial to establish baselines of normal firmware activity and incorporate whitelisting mechanisms for known update patterns.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification: Firmware-based reconnaissance can lead directly to exploitation, making early detection critical. Given the stealth nature of such activities, prioritizing their detection helps in preventing subsequent stages of the attack chain.

## Response

When an alert related to firmware reconnaissance fires:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify whether the activity is part of a legitimate update or maintenance operation.
2. **Containment Measures:** If malicious intent is suspected, isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further probing.
3. **Incident Reporting:** Document findings and escalate according to organizational incident response protocols.
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify how adversaries accessed the firmware and patch vulnerabilities to prevent recurrence.

This strategy provides a structured approach for detecting firmware-based reconnaissance tactics, emphasizing early detection and comprehensive analysis across multiple data sources. By understanding potential adversarial behaviors and implementing robust monitoring practices, organizations can enhance their defensive posture against such sophisticated threats.
