# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to discover and enumerate cloud storage objects using services like AWS S3. The focus is on detecting unauthorized access and reconnaissance activities that may lead to data exfiltration or other malicious actions.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1619 - Cloud Storage Object Discovery
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** IaaS

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages cloud provider logs, network traffic analysis, and user behavior analytics to identify patterns indicative of unauthorized discovery attempts. Key data sources include AWS CloudTrail logs for API activity, VPC Flow Logs for network traffic, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems for correlation and anomaly detection.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual access patterns in CloudTrail logs, such as excessive listing or accessing bucket metadata.
- Network traffic anomalies detected by analyzing VPC Flow Logs.
- Deviations from baseline user behaviors indicative of reconnaissance activities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use enumeration techniques to gain insights into cloud storage objects, which can inform further attacks. Techniques include using AWS CLI commands or scripts to list and describe buckets and their contents. For example:

```bash
aws s3 ls --region us-east-1
aws s3api list-buckets
```

These actions generate logs that can be detected by monitoring for specific API calls indicative of enumeration activities.

### Adversary Emulation Details
To emulate this technique, an adversary might execute the following AWS CLI commands to enumerate S3 buckets:
```bash
aws s3 ls --region us-east-1
aws s3api list-buckets
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss sophisticated adversaries using stealthy enumeration techniques.
  - Limited visibility if logging is not enabled or misconfigured.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes access to comprehensive cloud logs and monitoring tools.
  - Relies on predefined baselines for normal user behavior.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks involving frequent listing of S3 buckets.
- Automated backup or synchronization processes accessing multiple buckets.
- Developers using CLI tools during development cycles to test cloud resources.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Unauthorized discovery and enumeration can lead directly to data exfiltration, insider threats, or further exploitation. Given the sensitivity of data stored in cloud environments, early detection is crucial to prevent significant security breaches.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### AWS S3 Enumeration Test Scenario

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Create an isolated AWS account with a few dummy S3 buckets.
   - Ensure CloudTrail logging and VPC Flow Logs are enabled.

2. **Emulate Adversarial Activity:**
   - Use the AWS CLI to execute enumeration commands:
     ```bash
     aws s3 ls --region us-east-1
     aws s3api list-buckets
     ```

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Check CloudTrail logs for API calls related to `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetBucketLocation`.
   - Analyze VPC Flow Logs for unusual outbound traffic patterns.

4. **Verify Detection:**
   - Ensure that the detection system flags these activities as potential enumeration attempts.
   - Correlate with user behavior analytics to differentiate from legitimate activity.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating possible S3 object discovery:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the source of the activity by cross-referencing with known user accounts and IP addresses.
   - Temporarily restrict access to sensitive buckets if unauthorized activity is confirmed.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review CloudTrail logs for additional context on the enumeration activity.
   - Conduct a broader investigation into potential lateral movement or other indicators of compromise (IoCs).

3. **Remediation and Reporting:**
   - If malicious intent is confirmed, escalate to incident response teams for further action.
   - Document findings and update security policies to prevent future occurrences.

4. **Communication:**
   - Notify relevant stakeholders about the potential breach and ongoing investigation status.
