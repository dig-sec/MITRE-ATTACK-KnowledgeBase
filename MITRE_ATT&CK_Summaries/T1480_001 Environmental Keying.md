# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Use of Containers to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves recognizing when attackers leverage container technologies to obscure their activities from detection mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1480.001 - Environmental Keying
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring for anomalous use of container technologies which may indicate attempts to evade security systems. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- Host-level system logs
- Network traffic analysis

Patterns analyzed involve unexpected changes in resource allocation, atypical network communications from containers, and irregular use patterns that deviate from the norm.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may deploy containers to obscure command-and-control (C2) traffic or execute malicious payloads within isolated environments. They might do this by:
- Creating ephemeral containers with complex networking configurations.
- Leveraging container escape vulnerabilities to gain host-level access.
- Using containers for persistence mechanisms that evade traditional endpoint detection.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
Sample commands could involve:
- `docker run -d --net=host <malicious_image>`
- Kubernetes pod creation with unusual resource requests: 
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: malicious-pod
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: container
      image: <malicious_image>
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "10"
          memory: "20Gi"
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** Normal baseline behavior for container usage is well-defined and monitored.
- **Blind Spot:** Adversaries might use legitimate applications running in containers, making detection more challenging.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate development environments where container orchestration tools are heavily used.
- Temporary spikes in container creation during software deployment cycles or testing phases.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
Justification: Containers provide a sophisticated method for adversaries to hide malicious activity, posing significant risks if undetected. The ability to evade detection mechanisms can lead to prolonged unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. Immediately isolate affected containers or pods.
2. Conduct a detailed log analysis of container orchestration systems and host machines.
3. Correlate network traffic associated with suspicious containers for potential C2 communication.
4. Engage threat intelligence to identify known patterns or indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to the detected activity.
5. Update detection rules based on findings to enhance future alert accuracy.
