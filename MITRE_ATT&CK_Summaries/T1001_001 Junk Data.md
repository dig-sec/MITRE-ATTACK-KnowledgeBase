# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves identifying when attackers use container technology to obscure their activities and evade detection mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1001.001 - Junk Data
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

For more details, see the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/001).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of data sources such as container logs, network traffic, and system event logs to identify patterns indicative of adversarial activities. The focus is on anomalies in container behavior, unexpected inter-container communications, and unusual resource usage that may suggest an attempt to bypass security monitoring.

Key patterns analyzed include:
- Sudden spikes in resource consumption by containers.
- Unusual or unauthorized container deployments.
- Abnormal network traffic originating from containerized environments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use container technology due to its lightweight nature, ease of deployment, and ability to isolate processes. They may execute malicious activities within containers to avoid detection by traditional security tools that might not be configured to monitor such environments effectively.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In real-world scenarios, adversaries might:
- Deploy malware inside a container.
- Use containers for command-and-control (C2) communications.
- Exploit vulnerabilities in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

Sample commands used by adversaries may include:
- `docker run -d --rm --name malicious-container <image>`
- `kubectl create deployment --image=<malicious-image>`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection mechanisms might miss highly sophisticated attacks that mimic legitimate container usage patterns.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that monitoring systems are configured to capture detailed logs from containers and network traffic.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate spikes in resource usage during peak business operations.
- Authorized deployment of new applications or services within containers.
- Network testing or maintenance activities involving containerized environments.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used by both legitimate applications and adversaries. The ability to bypass security monitoring poses a significant risk, making it imperative to detect such attempts promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no specific step-by-step instructions available for emulating this technique in a test environment. Future efforts should focus on developing controlled scenarios that safely mimic adversarial behavior within containerized systems.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Investigate the Alert:** Examine logs and network traffic to confirm suspicious activity.
2. **Contain the Threat:** Isolate affected containers or nodes to prevent further spread.
3. **Analyze Impact:** Determine if any data exfiltration or system compromise occurred.
4. **Remediate:** Remove malicious containers, patch vulnerabilities, and restore normal operations.
5. **Report:** Document findings and update security policies as necessary.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional references available for this specific technique. Future reports should aim to include more comprehensive resources and contextual information as they become available.
