# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: External Defacement via T1491.002

## Goal
The primary objective of this detection strategy is to identify and prevent adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containers to achieve external defacement on web assets.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy utilizes a multi-faceted approach that incorporates both network and host-based data sources. By analyzing web server logs, container orchestration system metrics, and file integrity monitoring, the strategy identifies anomalies indicative of external defacement attempts.

- **Data Sources:**
  - Web server access logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
  - Container management platforms (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
  - File Integrity Monitoring tools
  - Network traffic analysis

- **Patterns Analyzed:**
  - Unusual spikes in HTTP 4xx/5xx error codes on web servers.
  - Unexpected changes to critical files or configurations within containers.
  - Unauthorized access patterns and modifications in orchestration platforms.
  - Anomalous network traffic between containers and external entities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit container environments by deploying malicious containers that compromise the host or other containers. This can involve injecting rogue images, altering configuration files, or leveraging insecure API endpoints to manipulate web servers directly for defacement purposes.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `kubectl run --image=malicious-image --port=80 my-bad-container`
  - Unauthorized access to web server directories: `cd /var/www/html; echo "<script>malicious_code</script>" > index.html`

### Test Scenarios:
1. Deploy a container with a known malicious image and observe detection capabilities.
2. Simulate unauthorized modifications to web server files within a containerized environment.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not account for sophisticated evasion techniques that adversaries use, such as encoding payloads or leveraging legitimate administrative tools to blend in with normal operations.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The presence of adequate logging and monitoring configurations across both host and container environments is assumed.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate updates or patches applied by administrators that modify web server files or configurations.
- Routine administrative tasks in container orchestration platforms that might appear as unauthorized changes.
- Network traffic spikes due to legitimate high-load events such as marketing campaigns or scheduled maintenance.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: External defacement can significantly damage an organization's reputation, lead to loss of customer trust, and potentially result in legal ramifications. Given the critical nature of web-facing services, prioritizing this detection strategy is crucial.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available for emulating T1491.002 in a test environment. Future updates may include detailed adversary emulation procedures to better validate detection mechanisms.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected containers and web servers to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of logs to determine the source and method of the defacement attempt.
- Review container orchestration policies and configurations for any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
- Revert compromised files or configurations to their previous state using backups.
- Update security controls to prevent similar incidents, such as strengthening network segmentation, enhancing access controls, and improving anomaly detection mechanisms.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context are available. Future iterations of this strategy may incorporate further resources for enhanced understanding and response capabilities.
