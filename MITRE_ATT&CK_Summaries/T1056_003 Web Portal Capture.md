# Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containerization technologies on various platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). It focuses on identifying actions that may involve exploiting containers as a means of concealment or evasion.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves analyzing data from multiple sources such as container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), logs from container runtimes (Docker, rkt), and host system activities. Patterns analyzed include unusual creation or configuration of containers, unexpected network traffic originating from containers, and unauthorized access to sensitive endpoints within a container environment.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to bypass security measures by deploying malicious applications that operate stealthily within isolated environments. These containers can facilitate persistence, data exfiltration, and lateral movement while remaining under the radar of traditional monitoring tools. Common tactics include:
- Deploying covertly running services within a container.
- Using containers to execute privilege escalation scripts.
- Masking network traffic by routing it through containerized proxies.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries might use commands such as:
- `docker run -d --name malicious_container <malicious_image>`
- Manipulating Kubernetes configurations with YAML files that specify unusual resource requests or limits to hide their activities.
  
Test scenarios could involve deploying containers in a test environment and attempting to establish unauthorized connections to external systems.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss highly sophisticated evasion techniques where adversaries use legitimate container deployments for malicious purposes without obvious signs.
  - Containerized applications with minimal or no network footprint could bypass detection mechanisms focused on network traffic analysis.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has proper logging and monitoring configured for both host systems and containers.
  - Analysts are familiar with normal operational patterns within containerized environments to distinguish anomalies effectively.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development or testing purposes that involve unusual configurations or network connections.
- Misconfigured security policies leading to benign activities being flagged as suspicious.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

**Justification:** Containers are increasingly used in modern IT environments, and their misuse can lead to significant breaches. The ability of adversaries to hide malicious activity within containers poses a severe risk due to the potential for persistence, data exfiltration, and lateral movement undetected by traditional security tools.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
- None available

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should promptly investigate the source of the alert, focusing on container logs, runtime activities, and network traffic.
2. **Containment Measures:** Isolate affected containers to prevent potential spread or data leakage.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine how adversaries gained access to deploy or manipulate containers.
4. **Enhance Monitoring:** Update detection rules and monitoring systems based on findings to reduce future risks.
