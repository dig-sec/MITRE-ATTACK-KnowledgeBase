# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring using containers. This detection strategy focuses on identifying malicious activities that involve the use of containerized environments to avoid traditional security measures and evade detection.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages a combination of data sources including network traffic logs, endpoint detection and response (EDR) outputs, and container orchestration platform logs. Patterns analyzed include unusual behaviors related to the creation and manipulation of containers, as well as anomalous use of Office add-ins such as Excel XLL files, Word WLL files, VBA-based XLAM for Excel, and PPAM for PowerPoint.

The strategy involves monitoring for unexpected container activities like unauthorized creation or modification, abnormal network traffic patterns associated with containers, and the deployment of potentially malicious Office add-ins that could be used to execute code persistently within a compromised environment. 

## Technical Context

In real-world scenarios, adversaries exploit containers by creating isolated environments where they can run their payloads without detection from standard security tools that might not have visibility into containerized workloads. They often use these techniques to maintain persistence and evade monitoring systems.

Adversaries may execute malicious code through Office add-ins such as XLL files in Excel, WLL files in Word, or VBA-based add-ins like XLAM for Excel and PPAM for PowerPoint. These add-ins can be leveraged to load additional payloads or establish backdoors.

### Adversary Emulation Details

1. **Code Execution via Excel Add-in File (XLL):**
   - Simulate the loading of a malicious XLL file within Excel.
   - Observe any network connections or unexpected processes initiated by the add-in.

2. **Persistent Code Execution via Excel Add-in File (XLL):**
   - Embed code within an XLL file that ensures execution on subsequent Excel launches, potentially modifying startup configurations.

3. **Persistent Code Execution via Word Add-in File (WLL):**
   - Introduce a WLL file to Word and validate its persistence through abnormal configurations or behavior alterations in the document management system.

4. **Persistent Code Execution via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM):**
   - Deploy an XLAM file containing malicious macros that execute upon opening Excel, ensuring persistence by manipulating registry keys or configuration files.

5. **Persistent Code Execution via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM):**
   - Load a PPAM add-in in PowerPoint and verify its ability to persistently launch harmful code through embedded scripts or configurations altered on startup.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- Limited visibility into containerized environments if containers are isolated from traditional monitoring tools.
- Assumes all containers within the monitored environment adhere to standard logging practices.
- Potential blind spots include encrypted traffic within containers that bypasses inspection by conventional security mechanisms.

## False Positives

- Legitimate use of Office add-ins for business operations, which might resemble malicious activity.
- Authorized container activities in environments with dynamic workloads or legitimate development/testing scenarios.
- Automated processes that create and terminate containers frequently as part of CI/CD pipelines.

## Priority

**High:** The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant threat due to the potential for undetected persistence and lateral movement within an organization's infrastructure. This technique allows adversaries to operate under the radar, making it crucial to prioritize its detection and mitigation.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

To validate this strategy in a test environment:

1. **Set up** a controlled environment with Office applications and container orchestration.
2. **Deploy** each add-in file (XLL, WLL, XLAM, PPAM) into their respective Office environments and monitor for unexpected behaviors or persistence mechanisms.
3. **Simulate container creation and manipulation** to observe any evasion tactics employed by adversaries.
4. **Analyze logs** from network traffic, EDR outputs, and container orchestration platforms for anomalies.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Isolate** the affected systems to prevent further spread of potential threats.
2. **Investigate** the source of the activity, focusing on both the Office add-in behavior and any associated container activities.
3. **Eradicate** any identified malicious components from the environment.
4. **Review and update** security policies to enhance monitoring capabilities for similar future attempts.
