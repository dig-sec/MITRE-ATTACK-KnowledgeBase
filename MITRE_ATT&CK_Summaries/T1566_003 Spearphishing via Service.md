# Detection Strategy: Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring by utilizing containerization technologies. This involves recognizing when adversaries are leveraging containers to evade detection and gain unauthorized access.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1566.003 - Spearphishing via Service
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Initial Access
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing data sources that include container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes), network traffic, and system event logs. The focus is on identifying anomalous patterns such as unauthorized container deployments or unusual service configurations indicative of adversarial activity.

Key patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual spikes in container deployment activities.
- Service anomalies not aligned with baseline behaviors.
- Network traffic originating from containers that bypasses expected paths.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by deploying rogue containers within a compromised environment, using these containers to facilitate lateral movement or data exfiltration. They often exploit vulnerabilities in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker and utilize spear-phishing tactics to gain initial access.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - `docker run --privileged -d <malicious_image>`
  - `kubectl create deployment <name> --image=<malicious_container_image>`
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploying a container with elevated privileges.
  - Establishing a reverse shell within a container to communicate with an external command and control server.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Known Limitations:** 
  - Detection strategies may not cover all configurations of container orchestration platforms.
  - Adversaries continually evolve their techniques, potentially rendering current detection patterns obsolete.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Baselines for normal behavior are accurately established across environments.
  - Security monitoring tools have full visibility into container activities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate rapid deployment of containers during peak operational periods.
- Authorized administrative activities involving privileged access to containers for maintenance or updates.

## Priority
**Severity Assessment: High**

Justification:
- Containers are increasingly used in modern IT infrastructures, making them attractive targets for adversaries aiming to bypass traditional security measures.
- The potential impact includes unauthorized data access and exfiltration, leading to significant operational disruption and confidentiality breaches.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no standardized step-by-step instructions are available for emulation. Organizations should develop custom scenarios based on their specific environment configurations and threat models.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- Immediately isolate the affected containers from the network.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the source of compromise.
- Review recent changes in container deployments and access controls.
- Update security policies to prevent similar incidents, ensuring continuous monitoring enhancements.

## Additional Resources
At this stage, no additional references or context are available. However, organizations should keep abreast of emerging threats related to containerization and update their detection strategies accordingly.
