# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves identifying efforts by threat actors to exploit containerization technologies for obfuscating malicious activities and evading detection.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1211 - Exploitation for Defense Evasion
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a multi-source approach to identify unusual container activity that may indicate attempts at defense evasion. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs**: Monitoring for abnormal commands or configurations within container logs.
- **Network Traffic**: Analyzing network traffic patterns originating from containers for anomalies.
- **File System Changes**: Detecting unexpected changes in the file system within container environments.

Patterns analyzed include unusual resource allocation, frequent container restarts, and atypical access patterns to sensitive data stores. The strategy aims to correlate these indicators across different data sources to improve detection accuracy.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers by leveraging their isolated nature to hide malicious activities from traditional security tools. This can be achieved through:

- **Resource Concealment**: Running malicious processes within containers that are not monitored.
- **Network Segmentation Abuse**: Using container networks to obfuscate command and control traffic.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries may execute the following steps:
1. Create a benign-looking container image with embedded payloads.
2. Deploy the container on compromised or vulnerable hosts.
3. Use shell scripts within containers to periodically mutate or delete logs to cover tracks.

Example command for adversary emulation:
```bash
docker run -d --name evasive-container myimage /bin/bash -c "while true; do some_malicious_activity; sleep 3600; done"
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots**:
  - Detection might miss sophisticated evasion techniques that dynamically adapt to the monitoring environment.
  - Encrypted container traffic could bypass network-based detection mechanisms.

- **Assumptions**:
  - Assumes a baseline of normal container behavior is established for accurate anomaly detection.
  - Relies on comprehensive logging and monitoring configurations being in place.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative tasks involving frequent container restarts or reconfigurations.
- High-volume batch processing jobs within containers that exhibit unusual network patterns.
- Development environments with rapid changes to container setups.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
The ability of adversaries to exploit containers for defense evasion poses a significant risk, especially in environments where containerization is prevalent. The potential impact includes undetected data exfiltration and persistent access within the target environment.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no step-by-step instructions are available for adversary emulation due to the dynamic nature of this technique. However, organizations can simulate basic scenarios using container management tools to assess detection capabilities.

## Response
When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Isolate affected containers and networks.
   - Review logs for any suspicious activities or commands executed within the containers.

2. **Containment**:
   - Halt any ongoing processes within the flagged containers.
   - Update security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.

3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and impact of the detected activity.
   - Collaborate with incident response teams for remediation strategies.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Document findings and update threat intelligence feeds with new indicators of compromise (IOCs).

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context are available. Organizations should consult their internal security policies and industry best practices for further guidance on container security.
