## Goal
The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containerization technologies.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying adversarial use of containers to circumvent security monitoring. It leverages data from container runtime environments, network traffic analysis, and system logs to identify suspicious patterns. Specifically, the strategy looks for anomalies such as unusual network communications initiated by containers, unauthorized changes in container configurations, and unexpected creation or modification of container images.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use container technologies like Docker or Kubernetes to execute malicious activities while attempting to evade detection. Common methods include:
- Deploying malware within a container that mimics legitimate services.
- Modifying container orchestration configurations to hide processes.
- Using containers for command-and-control (C2) communications.

### Adversary Emulation Details
1. **Sample Commands:**
   - `docker pull [malicious_image]`: Pulls a malicious image from a repository.
   - `kubectl apply -f [mod_config.yaml]`: Applies unauthorized configuration changes to Kubernetes clusters.

2. **Test Scenarios:**
   - Create and run a container using an obfuscated or renamed malicious binary.
   - Establish outbound connections to known C2 servers through containerized services.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- The strategy assumes that all containers are being monitored at the network level, which may not cover isolated environments.
- Detection relies on having baseline behaviors established for typical container activities within an organization.
- It does not account for advanced evasion techniques like rootkit-level modifications to container runtimes.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for testing or development purposes involving temporary network communications.
- Authorized updates to orchestration configurations that are misclassified as unauthorized changes.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability of adversaries to bypass traditional security monitoring through containerization poses a significant risk. This technique can facilitate undetected lateral movement and exfiltration, impacting the confidentiality and integrity of critical systems.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
*None available*

## Response
When an alert triggers:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate affected containers and networks to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Analyze container logs and network traffic for additional indicators of malicious activity.

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Review changes in container configurations against authorized baselines.
   - Examine the origin and purpose of any suspicious network communications initiated by containers.

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Implement stricter access controls on container registries and orchestration tools.
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities with additional anomaly detection layers specifically tuned for container environments.
