# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of Golden Tickets in Windows Environments

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using "Golden Tickets" on Windows platforms. This involves detecting unauthorized access and misuse of Kerberos authentication tickets that allow adversaries to impersonate any user in an Active Directory environment.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1558.001 - Golden Ticket
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages security event logs, network traffic analysis, and system audit trails to identify anomalies indicative of Golden Ticket usage. Key data sources include:

- **Security Event Logs:** Monitor for unusual Kerberos ticket requests or logins that do not match known user patterns.
- **Active Directory Audit Logs:** Look for unauthorized changes in key AD objects like krbtgt account.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Detect abnormal authentication traffic volumes or destinations.

The strategy analyzes patterns such as:

- Multiple simultaneous logins using the same credentials across different machines.
- Logins at unusual times or from unexpected geographical locations.
- Changes to high-value accounts without proper authorization.

## Technical Context
Golden Tickets are forged Kerberos tickets that allow attackers to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to resources in a Windows domain. Adversaries typically execute this technique by:

1. Compromising the krbtgt account, often through techniques like pass-the-hash or pass-the-ticket.
2. Using tools such as `mimikatz` or `Rubeus` to create Golden Tickets that provide unrestricted access within the domain.

Adversary emulation might involve using these tools to simulate attacks in a controlled environment:

- **Mimikatz Command:**  
  ```shell
  mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /user:username /domain:domainname /sid:S-1-5-21-xxxxxx /krbtgt:HASH /ticket:outputfile.kirbi"
  ```

- **Rubeus Command:**  
  ```shell
  Rubeus.exe golden /rc4:HASH /user:USERNAME /domain:DOMAINNAME /sid:S-1-5-21-xxxxx /ptt
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
### Limitations:
- Detection may not cover all variations of Golden Ticket usage, especially if adversaries employ sophisticated obfuscation.
- Assumes that baseline activity patterns are well-established for effective anomaly detection.

### Assumptions:
- Active Directory audit logging is enabled and properly configured to capture relevant events.
- Security teams have established a baseline understanding of normal network traffic and user behavior.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative tasks involving krbtgt account modifications, which might mimic malicious activity if not documented or communicated.
- Scheduled automated scripts running Kerberos ticket requests at unusual times.

## Priority
The severity of this threat is assessed as **High** due to the potential for widespread unauthorized access and data exfiltration within an organization's domain. The ability to impersonate any user without detection poses a significant risk to both security and operational integrity.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate the detection strategy, follow these steps in a test environment:

1. **Setup Test Environment:** Prepare a controlled Windows domain with Active Directory.
2. **Compromise krbtgt Account:**
   - Use tools like Mimikatz or Rubeus to extract the NTLM hash of the krbtgt account (ensure this is done legally and ethically).
3. **Craft Golden Ticket:**
   - Using `mimikatz`:
     ```shell
     mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /user:tester /domain:testlab.local /sid:S-1-5-21-xxxxxx /krbtgt:HASH /ticket:golden.kirbi"
     ```
   - Using `Rubeus`:
     ```shell
     Rubeus.exe golden /rc4:HASH /user:TESTER /domain:TESTLAB.LOCAL /sid:S-1-5-21-xxxxx /ptt
     ```

4. **Test Detection:** Execute the crafted Golden Ticket in a controlled manner and observe if detection mechanisms flag this activity appropriately.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Incident Investigation:**
   - Review security logs for related anomalies or suspicious activities.
   - Validate the source of Golden Tickets by cross-referencing with known user behaviors and authorized administrative tasks.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset compromised krbtgt account passwords.
   - Revoke any unauthorized Kerberos tickets using domain controllers.
