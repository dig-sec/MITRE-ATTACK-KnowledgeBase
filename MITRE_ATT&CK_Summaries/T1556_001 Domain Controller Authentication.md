# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting Windows containers. The focus is on detecting suspicious activities that leverage containerization features for malicious purposes.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring key data sources such as Windows Event Logs, container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), and network traffic. By analyzing patterns that indicate abnormal behavior in container usage or unexpected access to domain controllers, this approach aims to identify potential threats early.

Key aspects include:
- Monitoring for unusual access patterns within containers.
- Detecting attempts to use containers as a mechanism to gain unauthorized access to domain controller credentials.
- Identifying anomalous network traffic originating from containers that may indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit container environments by running malicious workloads, using containers for persistence, and evading detection through privilege escalation. They might leverage misconfigurations in container orchestration platforms to execute arbitrary commands or access sensitive resources unnoticed.

Common adversary techniques include:
- **Abnormal Container Activity:** Running unauthorized processes within a container that mimic legitimate operations.
- **Credential Access via Containers:** Exploiting container privileges to obtain domain controller credentials.
  
Example of an adversary command for testing purposes might involve using `docker exec` to execute commands inside a compromised container, attempting to connect to the domain controller.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
### Known Limitations:
- Detection relies on having comprehensive visibility into both host systems and container orchestration environments.
- Assumes that monitoring tools are correctly configured to capture relevant events and logs.

### Assumptions:
- The environment has implemented baseline security measures, such as network segmentation and least privilege principles for containers.
- Container logs are centrally collected and available for analysis.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of container management tools by system administrators for routine tasks.
- Authorized testing or development activities involving domain controllers within a secure environment.
- Network traffic from containers used for legitimate inter-service communication.

To minimize false positives, it is recommended to establish baselines and regularly update detection rules to reflect typical usage patterns in the specific operational context.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
The technique addresses critical security concerns related to credential access, persistence, and defense evasion. Containers, if compromised, can be used as pivot points for deeper infiltration into enterprise networks, making this a high-priority detection area.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Cross-reference with other monitoring tools to confirm the legitimacy of the detected activity.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers and review permissions associated with them.
3. **Investigation:**
   - Examine logs for anomalous commands or access attempts.
   - Identify the origin of suspicious activities within the container environment.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Patch vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
   - Review and strengthen container security policies.

5. **Documentation:** Record the incident details, response actions taken, and any lessons learned to improve future detection strategies.
