# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing containers. This involves identifying the use of containerized environments as a means for adversaries to obscure their activities from detection systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1102.001 - Dead Drop Resolver
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis, container runtime logs, and host-level monitoring to identify anomalous behavior indicative of adversarial use of containers. Key data sources include:

- **Container Runtime Logs:** Monitoring for unusual container startup patterns or unexpected image downloads.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identifying unexplained outbound connections from containerized applications.
- **Host-Level System Calls:** Observing syscall anomalies related to container activities that might suggest attempts to evade detection.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual spikes in network traffic originating from container endpoints.
- Containers being launched with configurations or permissions beyond typical use cases.
- Use of known malicious IP addresses or domains within container communication channels.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers for their ability to encapsulate applications and execute them in isolated environments. This can help them evade traditional security measures by masking their activities as legitimate processes running inside benign containers. In practice, adversaries may use containers to host command-and-control (C2) servers or exfiltrate data without triggering alerts.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - Launching a container with elevated privileges: `docker run --privileged --rm -d malicious-image`
  - Establishing outbound connections from within a container using tools like `curl` or `wget`.

- **Test Scenarios:** Simulate the deployment of a containerized application that attempts to connect to an external server on non-standard ports.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss highly sophisticated adversaries who dynamically generate container images to evade signature-based detection.
  - Containers running in environments without comprehensive logging can bypass monitoring efforts.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The presence of network traffic or syscalls indicative of adversarial activity is sufficient for alert generation.
  - Organizations have implemented baseline security controls on their container platforms.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development and testing environments, which may exhibit similar patterns to malicious usage.
- Scheduled or automated tasks within containers that produce network traffic spikes or unusual syscalls.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability of adversaries to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant threat, as it can lead to undetected data exfiltration, command-and-control communications, and persistent access. Given the increasing adoption of container technology in enterprise environments, this detection strategy is critical for maintaining robust security postures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no step-by-step instructions available for adversary emulation specific to this technique. Organizations should develop their own test scenarios based on the provided context and sample commands.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential adversarial use of containers:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected container environment from the network.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the container images and configurations used.
   - Review logs for any signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Follow-up Actions:**
   - Update security policies to enforce stricter controls on container deployment and runtime behavior.
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect similar patterns in the future.
   - Report findings to relevant stakeholders and update incident response plans accordingly.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional references or context available for this technique. Organizations should refer to broader resources on container security practices and threat intelligence feeds for more information.
