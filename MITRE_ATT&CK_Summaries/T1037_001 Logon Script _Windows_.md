# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Use of Logon Scripts on Windows Systems

## **Goal**
The aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to use logon scripts for maintaining persistence and elevating privileges on Windows systems. This technique involves adversaries leveraging script-based methods embedded in user login processes to execute malicious activities without detection.

## **Categorization**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1037.001 - Logon Script (Windows)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** 
  - Persistence
  - Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001)

## **Strategy Abstract**
This detection strategy utilizes logon script data from security information and event management (SIEM) systems to identify unusual or unauthorized use of logon scripts. By analyzing patterns such as unexpected script execution, changes in file paths or command-line arguments, and deviations from typical user behavior, we can detect adversarial activities. Key data sources include:
- Event logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs)
- Security monitoring tools
- SIEM alerts

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries may execute this technique by embedding malicious commands within legitimate logon scripts like `autoexec.bat`, `.cmd` files, or PowerShell scripts set to run at user login. These scripts can be used to download additional payloads, escalate privileges, or perform lateral movement.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Commands and Techniques:**
  - Modifying registry entries under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` to execute specific commands at logon.
  - Using the `net user /script [file_path]` command to set a script that runs during login.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Creating benign and malicious test scripts to verify detection capabilities.
  - Observing changes in registry settings related to logon scripts.

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- The strategy assumes proper configuration and integration of SIEM with Windows event logging mechanisms.
- Detection may not cover all sophisticated evasion techniques where adversaries disguise the script content or use alternate scripting languages.
- Limited detection capability if logon scripts are executed from non-standard locations or with obfuscated file names.

## **False Positives**
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks involving automated logon scripts for routine system configurations.
- Standard user actions like setting up startup applications via known, authorized methods.

## **Priority**
**High**: Given the potential impact of adversaries using logon scripts to maintain persistence and escalate privileges, this detection strategy is prioritized highly. Early detection of such activities can prevent significant security breaches and data exfiltration.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**
### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Configure a Windows virtual machine with logging capabilities enabled.
   
2. **Modify Registry for Logon Script Execution:**
   - Open `regedit` and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`.
   - Create or modify the `ScriptsRunAtLogOn` value, inputting a test script path.

3. **Create Test Scripts:**
   - Develop benign scripts that perform routine tasks (e.g., network diagnostics) and store them in accessible locations.
   - Create malicious-looking scripts containing harmless commands to simulate adversarial behavior.

4. **Execute Logon Scripts:**
   - Initiate user logins to trigger the execution of configured scripts.
   
5. **Monitor Logs and SIEM Alerts:**
   - Capture logs related to script execution using Windows Event Viewer or integrated security tools.
   - Verify alerts generated by SIEM systems to confirm detection efficacy.

## **Response**
Upon alert activation, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network.
- Review logon scripts and registry settings for unauthorized changes.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of recent user activities related to script modifications.
- Update security controls to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and prevent future occurrences.
