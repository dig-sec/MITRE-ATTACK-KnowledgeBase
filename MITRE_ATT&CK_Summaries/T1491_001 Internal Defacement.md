# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring mechanisms through the use of containers. By focusing on container activities, we can identify and mitigate efforts by adversaries to obscure their operations within containerized environments.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container activities across various platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows). Key data sources include system logs from container orchestrators such as Kubernetes and Docker. The analysis focuses on unusual patterns in container creation, execution, and resource usage that may indicate adversarial behavior.

### Data Sources:
- Container orchestration logs (Kubernetes, Docker)
- System event logs
- Network traffic associated with container communication

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Creation of unauthorized or unexpected containers
- Unusual network traffic originating from container endpoints
- Anomalies in resource consumption (CPU/memory spikes)

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to bypass security monitoring by isolating their activities and leveraging the ephemeral nature of containers. In practice, adversaries might deploy malicious payloads within containers that are designed to evade detection by traditional endpoint security solutions.

### Adversary Emulation:
- Use container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) to deploy unauthorized containers.
- Execute commands such as `docker run -d <malicious_image>` or `kubectl create deployment --image=<malicious_image>`.
- Observe changes in network traffic and resource usage that deviate from baseline behaviors.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
### Known Limitations:
- Detection may miss highly sophisticated adversarial techniques that mimic normal container behavior.
- Assumes baseline patterns of legitimate container activity are well-understood and documented.

### Assumptions:
- Security monitoring tools have visibility into all container orchestration platforms in use.
- The environment has established baselines for normal container activities to identify anomalies effectively.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment of new containers as part of routine operations.
- Temporary spikes in resource usage during legitimate testing or development activities.
- Network traffic patterns typical of regular inter-service communication within a microservices architecture.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used for deploying applications, making them attractive targets for adversaries. The ability to bypass security monitoring undetected poses significant risks to organizational assets and data integrity.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a controlled test environment:

1. **Replace Desktop Wallpaper**
   - Command: `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri "file:///path/to/image.jpg"`

2. **Configure LegalNoticeCaption and LegalNoticeText Registry Keys**
   - Open Registry Editor (`regedit`).
   - Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System`.
   - Create/modify the following keys:
     - `LegalNoticeCaption`: "Attention"
     - `LegalNoticeText`: "System has been compromised"

3. **ESXi - Change Welcome Message on Direct Console User Interface (DCUI)**
   - Access ESXi host via direct console.
   - Navigate to System Customization and change the welcome message.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. Verify if a legitimate operation triggered the alert by checking recent deployment activities or maintenance schedules.
2. Analyze container logs for signs of malicious activity, such as unexpected commands or network connections.
3. Isolate suspicious containers to prevent further potential impact.
4. Update security policies and baselines based on findings to enhance detection accuracy.

## Additional Resources
- **Tunneling Tool Execution**: Investigate if adversaries are using tunneling tools within containers to obscure their activities.
- **Container Security Best Practices**: Implement robust security controls for container environments, including runtime protection and network segmentation.

By following this framework, organizations can effectively detect and respond to adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers.
