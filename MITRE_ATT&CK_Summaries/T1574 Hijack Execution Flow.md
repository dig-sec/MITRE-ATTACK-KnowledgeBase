# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by exploiting container environments. The goal is to identify when adversaries leverage containers to execute malicious activities undetected, thereby maintaining persistence and avoiding detection.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1574 - Hijack Execution Flow
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing container activity logs, system process behaviors, and network traffic associated with containers. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Host system event logs
- Network traffic analysis

Patterns to analyze include unusual or unauthorized container spawning, unexpected host interactions, lateral movement attempts between containers, and anomalies in resource usage that deviate from normal operational baselines.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit container environments by deploying malicious workloads within containers, often using compromised images or exploiting misconfigurations. They may hijack execution flow to evade detection while leveraging the isolation of containers for persistence and privilege escalation.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Compromising a Docker image repository.
  - Spawning unauthorized containers with privileged access.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a container with escalated privileges to test detection mechanisms.
  - Execute network scanning commands from within a container.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:
- Detection may not cover all zero-day vulnerabilities in container runtimes.
- Assumes baseline behavior models are accurately defined for normal operations.
- Dependencies on the completeness of log data and proper configuration of monitoring tools.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment of containers with elevated privileges during software updates or maintenance.
- Development environments where developers frequently spin up new containers as part of their workflow.

## Priority
**Severity: High**
Justification: The use of containers for bypassing security monitoring can lead to significant undetected persistence, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within the network. This poses a substantial threat to organizational security posture and data integrity.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine affected containers to prevent further unauthorized activity.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Review container logs for suspicious activities or commands executed.
   - Analyze host system events for any signs of compromise or unusual behavior.
3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the entry point and scope of the breach.
   - Identify compromised images or containers involved in the incident.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Patch vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.
   - Update container images and configurations to prevent recurrence.
5. **Reporting:** Document findings and update security protocols accordingly.
