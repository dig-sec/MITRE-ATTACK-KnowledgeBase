# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition

## Goal

The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers on macOS systems. Specifically, it focuses on the use of the `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` addition in Mach-O binaries, which can be employed by adversaries to load dynamic libraries during the execution of a program, potentially allowing them to execute malicious payloads or evade detection.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** macOS

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring for the use of `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` in Mach-O binaries executed on macOS systems. This can be achieved by leveraging endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools that analyze file system changes, process execution events, and dynamic library loading activities.

Key data sources include:

- **Process Monitoring:** Track processes attempting to load dynamic libraries at runtime.
- **File Integrity Monitoring:** Detect modifications to Mach-O binaries indicating the addition of `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` entries.
- **Log Analysis:** Examine system logs for unusual patterns or unauthorized use of dynamic library loading.

Patterns analyzed will focus on unexpected or unauthorized changes in binaries that could indicate an adversary's attempt to introduce persistence mechanisms or escalate privileges.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may execute this technique by modifying existing Mach-O binaries to include `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` entries, allowing them to load additional libraries at runtime. This can be used for code injection, evading detection, or establishing persistent access on the system.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Identify a target binary:** Choose an executable that you have permission to modify.
2. **Create a dynamic library:** Develop a Mach-O dylib with malicious code (e.g., shellcode).
3. **Modify the target binary:** Use tools like `otool` and `install_name_tool` to add the `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` entry pointing to your dylib.
4. **Execute the modified binary:** Run it in a controlled environment to observe the dynamic library loading.

**Sample Commands:**

```bash
# Create a dummy dynamic library
echo -e "\x7f\x45\x4c\x46\x01\x01\x01\x00" > malicious.dylib

# Add LC_LOAD_DYLIB entry to a target executable
install_name_tool -add_rpath /path/to/malicious.dylib /path/to/target_binary
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss obfuscated or highly customized modifications that do not follow typical patterns.
- **Assumptions:** The system logs and monitoring tools are correctly configured to capture relevant events. The adversary does not employ advanced evasion techniques beyond the scope of `LC_LOAD_DYLIB`.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate software updates or installations that modify binaries.
- Development environments where dynamic library loading is common practice.
- Use of frameworks and libraries that dynamically load components as part of their normal operation.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

Justification: The technique can be used for significant adversarial actions such as privilege escalation and establishing persistence, which are critical to the success of an attack. Early detection is crucial to mitigating potential damage.

## Response

When the alert fires:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm that the dynamic library loading event is unauthorized or unexpected.
2. **Analyze the Binary:** Examine the modified binary for malicious changes using tools like `otool` and `strings`.
3. **Contain the Threat:** Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread of potential malware.
4. **Investigate Further:** Determine the source and method of compromise, and assess other potential vulnerabilities or breaches.
