# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Cached Domain Credentials (T1003.005)

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify and prevent adversaries from using cached domain credentials to access sensitive systems or data, thereby bypassing security monitoring mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1003.005 - Cached Domain Credentials
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/005)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on monitoring specific events and artifacts associated with the use of cached domain credentials. The key data sources include event logs, particularly those from security event logs (e.g., Event ID 4769: A logon was attempted using explicit credentials), and system logs that capture `cmdkey` operations. Patterns analyzed include unusual login attempts or credential storage activities indicative of potential abuse.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use cached domain credentials to maintain persistent access to compromised systems without re-authenticating, reducing their exposure to detection mechanisms. This technique is executed by capturing valid credentials (e.g., via phishing) and then storing them locally using tools like `cmdkey` or through exploiting misconfigured Windows services.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Using `cmdkey`: 
    ```shell
    cmdkey /add:TARGET_DOMAIN /user:USERNAME /pass:PASSWORD
    ```
  - This command stores credentials for a domain, allowing the adversary to authenticate using these cached credentials.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** 
  - Detection might miss scenarios where adversaries use alternative methods or tools not captured by current monitoring.
  - The strategy assumes that adversaries are attempting access with stolen or compromised credentials.
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that any unexpected usage of `cmdkey` for credential storage is indicative of malicious activity.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks involving credential caching for service accounts.
- IT personnel using `cmdkey` to configure or troubleshoot networked services legitimately.

## Priority
**High:** The use of cached domain credentials poses a significant threat as it allows adversaries to maintain persistent and stealthy access. Detecting this activity is crucial in preventing lateral movement within networks and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate T1003.005, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Use a controlled Windows environment with a domain controller or workgroup setup.
   
2. **Credential Capture:**
   - Obtain valid credentials for a test user account within the domain.

3. **Emulate Technique:**
   - Execute the `cmdkey` command to store the captured credentials:
     ```shell
     cmdkey /add:TEST_DOMAIN /user:TEST_USER /pass:TEST_PASSWORD
     ```

4. **Verify Detection:**
   - Check if the detection system logs an alert or event when the above actions are performed.

## Response
When the alert for cached domain credential usage fires, analysts should:

1. Verify the legitimacy of the credentials and their storage:
   - Confirm whether a valid business need exists for such operations.
   
2. Investigate user accounts involved in credential caching:
   - Review recent activities and access patterns.

3. Contain potential threats:
   - Revoke cached credentials where necessary and enforce password changes if compromise is suspected.

4. Conduct a thorough security review to prevent recurrence:
   - Assess security policies and configurations related to credential management.

This strategy provides a structured approach to detecting and mitigating the risks associated with the misuse of cached domain credentials, aligning with Palantir's ADS framework.
