# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technology. Attackers may use containers to obscure their activities, making it difficult for traditional security mechanisms to identify and respond to malicious behavior.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container usage and associated activities to identify potential adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs
- Network traffic related to containers
- Host system activity logs

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual network connections initiated by containers
- Anomalous resource consumption patterns (e.g., CPU, memory)
- Execution of uncommon or unauthorized container images
- Elevated privilege operations within containers

By correlating these data points, the strategy aims to detect indicators of adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to execute malicious activities while avoiding detection by traditional security tools. Containers provide isolation and can be rapidly deployed and terminated, making them attractive for adversaries seeking to conduct operations stealthily.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --rm -d [image]`: Run a container with an uncommon or unauthorized image.
  - `kubectl exec [pod] -- [command]`: Execute commands within a Kubernetes pod, potentially escalating privileges.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploying containers with network access to sensitive internal resources without proper authorization.
  - Using containers to dynamically load and execute malicious code.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Encrypted container traffic may evade detection if not properly decrypted for analysis.
  - Container escape techniques could allow adversaries to bypass isolation measures.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Security monitoring tools have access to comprehensive container runtime environments.
  - Network and host logs are sufficiently detailed to detect anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development or testing purposes, leading to high resource consumption.
- Deployment of new or uncommon container images by authorized users as part of routine operations.
- Temporary network spikes due to legitimate traffic patterns.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

Justification: Adversaries using containers can significantly undermine security monitoring efforts. The ability to rapidly deploy and hide malicious activities within containers poses a substantial threat, necessitating high-priority detection mechanisms.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Investigate the Source:** Verify the origin of container activity and assess whether it aligns with known legitimate operations.
2. **Analyze Network Traffic:** Examine network connections initiated by the suspicious container for signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
3. **Check Resource Usage:** Monitor resource consumption patterns to identify anomalies indicative of malicious behavior.
4. **Isolate Affected Systems:** Temporarily isolate containers and hosts involved in suspicious activity to prevent potential lateral movement.
5. **Review Logs:** Conduct a thorough review of container runtime, network, and host system logs for additional indicators of compromise.
