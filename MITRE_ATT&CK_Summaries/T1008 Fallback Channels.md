# Detection Strategy Report: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

The primary aim of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. Adversaries may exploit containers as a fallback channel to communicate with compromised systems, circumventing traditional security mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1008 - Fallback Channels
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activity to identify patterns indicative of unauthorized or malicious use. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Network traffic associated with container communications
- System call traces related to container orchestration and lifecycle management

Patterns analyzed involve unusual network connections originating from containers, unexpected interactions between containers and external systems, and anomalous scheduling or resource allocation that might suggest the use of containers for covert communication.

## Technical Context

In real-world scenarios, adversaries exploit container technologies by:

1. Establishing unauthorized containers to serve as command-and-control endpoints.
2. Utilizing existing container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) to deploy malicious workloads stealthily.
3. Exploiting vulnerabilities in container runtimes or misconfigurations to gain elevated privileges.

Adversaries may execute these actions using commands like:
- `docker run -d --network host <malicious_image>`
- `kubectl apply -f <malicious_k8s_config.yaml>`

These techniques allow adversaries to establish fallback channels that are harder for traditional security tools to detect due to their encapsulated and isolated nature.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

### Known Limitations:

- **Dynamic Environments:** In environments where containers are regularly deployed and decommissioned, distinguishing between benign and malicious activity can be challenging.
- **Resource Constraints:** Monitoring at scale may require significant computational resources, potentially impacting system performance.
- **Evasion Techniques:** Adversaries may employ advanced evasion techniques to obfuscate their activities within containers.

### Assumptions:

- Containers are configured with default network settings unless explicitly modified by security teams.
- Security monitoring tools have access to comprehensive container runtime and orchestration logs.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers for rapid deployment or testing purposes.
- Network scanning or diagnostic activities conducted within a development environment.
- Misconfigurations causing unintended interactions between containers and external systems.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification:
The ability to bypass traditional security monitoring by using containers poses significant risks, as it allows adversaries to establish persistent command-and-control channels that are difficult to detect. Given the increasing adoption of containerized environments in enterprise settings, the potential impact is substantial.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, there are no publicly available step-by-step instructions for emulating this technique in a test environment. However, organizations can simulate adversary behavior by:

1. Setting up a controlled container environment using tools like Docker or Kubernetes.
2. Deploying benign containers with network configurations that mimic those typically used in adversarial scenarios.
3. Monitoring the environment for unauthorized activity and adjusting detection parameters based on observed patterns.

## Response

When an alert related to this technique is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm whether the detected activity aligns with known legitimate operations or represents a potential threat.
2. **Contain the Threat:** If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate affected containers and networks to prevent further compromise.
3. **Investigate Further:** Analyze logs and network traffic for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) that may indicate broader adversary presence.
4. **Remediate:** Apply necessary patches or configuration changes to address vulnerabilities exploited by the adversary.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional references are available specifically addressing this detection technique within the scope of Palantir's ADS framework. Organizations should consult general resources on container security and MITRE ATT&CK for further context and guidance.
