## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring changes in web session cookies that could indicate manipulation by adversaries. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic Logs:** To capture HTTP and HTTPS traffic for cookie alterations.
- **Application Activity Logs:** From platforms like Office 365 and Google Workspace to identify unauthorized access patterns.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM) Logs:** To detect anomalous user behavior related to session hijacking.

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unexpected modifications of session cookies.
- Anomalous IP addresses accessing session data.
- Cross-domain requests that violate typical usage patterns.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often manipulate web session cookies to maintain persistent access without detection. This can be executed by:

1. Intercepting and altering HTTP traffic using tools like Burp Suite or Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
2. Injecting malicious scripts into web pages to modify cookie values, which may occur in phishing attacks.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries might execute commands such as:
- `curl -b "cookie_data" http://targetsite.com` to manually set cookies during a session.
- Using browser extensions or proxy tools to dynamically alter cookies in transit.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumptions:** Users' normal behavior is well-understood, allowing the distinction between legitimate changes and malicious ones.
- **Limitations:**
  - Difficulty in distinguishing between sophisticated attacks that mimic legitimate traffic patterns.
  - Potential challenges in environments with high legitimate cross-domain interactions.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate users accessing services from different geographic locations (e.g., business travel).
- Automated scripts or bots used for testing purposes, altering session parameters as part of their operations.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
**Justification:** 
The ability to manipulate web session cookies can lead to unauthorized access and lateral movement within sensitive environments. It poses a significant risk due to potential data breaches and prolonged undetected presence within the network.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify Anomalies:** Confirm if there are any legitimate reasons for the detected changes in session cookies.
2. **Conduct Threat Analysis:** Assess the scope of the access using IAM logs to determine if other accounts or resources have been compromised.
3. **Containment Measures:** Immediately revoke suspicious session tokens and enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) where applicable.
4. **Incident Investigation:** Initiate a detailed forensic analysis to understand the attack vector and affected assets.
5. **Notify Stakeholders:** Inform relevant security teams and, if necessary, impacted users about potential security breaches.
