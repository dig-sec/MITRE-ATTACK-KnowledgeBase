# Detection Strategy: Adversarial Use of Containerized Environments

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to exploit containerized environments for bypassing security monitoring systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1589.002 - Email Addresses
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Preparation)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and OpenShift for suspicious activities. Key data sources include:
- Container logs
- Network traffic to/from containers
- Configuration changes in orchestrators

Patterns analyzed include unusual resource allocation requests, abnormal network communications from containers, and unexpected configuration modifications.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containerized environments due to their ability to isolate processes and execute tasks without affecting the host system. Real-world execution may involve:
- Deploying malicious containers with elevated privileges.
- Utilizing sidecar containers for data exfiltration.
- Modifying orchestrator configurations to evade detection.

Adversary emulation can include commands like `kubectl exec` or `docker run --privileged`, simulating unauthorized actions within container environments.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into obfuscated or encrypted network traffic may hinder detection.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that baseline behavior for containers is well-established, which might not be the case in dynamic environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate testing of new container configurations.
- Routine updates or deployments by authorized personnel.

False alerts may also occur during peak usage times when resource requests spike naturally.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used in modern IT infrastructures. Adversarial use can lead to significant data breaches, making timely detection critical.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify the legitimacy of container activities.
2. **Isolate Suspicious Containers:** Temporarily halt operations for containers showing abnormal behavior.
3. **Analyze Network Traffic:** Check for unusual outbound connections or data transfers.
4. **Review Logs:** Examine logs for unauthorized access attempts or configuration changes.
5. **Update Security Controls:** Enhance container security policies and monitoring based on findings.
