# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to manipulate transmitted data through containers, aiming to bypass security monitoring systems.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Impact
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages network traffic analysis to identify anomalies indicative of data manipulation by adversaries. The primary data sources include:
- Network flow logs
- Container runtime logs
- System process logs

Patterns analyzed involve unexpected alterations in data payloads, unusual container behavior during transmission phases, and discrepancies between expected and actual transmitted data.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by injecting malicious code or altering data within containers to evade detection. This can be achieved through:
- Modifying container images with embedded backdoors.
- Intercepting and modifying data in transit using compromised network devices.
- Exploiting misconfigurations in container orchestration platforms.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries might use commands such as:
- `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh` to gain shell access within a running container.
- Network traffic manipulation tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark` for intercepting and altering data streams.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Encrypted network traffic may obscure detection capabilities unless decrypted by security systems. 
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that anomalies in data transmission are indicative of malicious activity, which might not always be the case.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate updates to container images.
- Network optimization processes that alter packet headers or payloads.
- Routine debugging and logging by developers within containers.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Data manipulation can lead to significant data breaches, impacting organizational integrity and confidentiality. Given the criticality of transmitted data in modern infrastructures, this technique poses a substantial threat.

## Response
When an alert triggers:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should begin by verifying the nature of the detected anomaly.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further potential manipulation or data exfiltration.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Examine logs and network traffic for evidence of malicious activity.
4. **Remediation:** Apply necessary patches, update configurations, and ensure all container images are verified against a known good baseline.
