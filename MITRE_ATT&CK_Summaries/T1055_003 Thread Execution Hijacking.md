# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. Specifically, it targets adversaries who leverage thread execution hijacking within containerized environments on Windows platforms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1055.003 - Thread Execution Hijacking
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:**
  - Defense Evasion
  - Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/003)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages logs and telemetry data from container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It focuses on identifying anomalies in thread execution patterns indicative of hijacking attempts. Key data sources include:

- **Process Monitoring Logs:** For unexpected changes in process threads.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** To detect unusual communication patterns between containers.
- **File Integrity Checks:** On critical system files to identify unauthorized modifications.

The strategy analyzes patterns such as:
- Unexpected thread creation or termination within containerized processes.
- Unusual spikes in CPU usage associated with specific threads.
- Irregular inter-container communications that deviate from established baselines.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may execute thread execution hijacking by manipulating the scheduling and execution of threads to evade detection, elevate privileges, or maintain persistence. This technique involves:

- **Subverting Thread Scheduling:** By altering process priorities or using native API calls to manipulate thread states.
- **Code Injection into Threads:** Injecting malicious code into existing legitimate processes.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique:
1. **Setup a Container Environment:** Use Docker on Windows with multiple containers running different services.
2. **Execute Malicious Payloads:** Use PowerShell scripts to inject and execute shellcode within a thread of a target process.
3. **Monitor Thread Execution:** Observe changes in thread activity using tools like Process Explorer.

Sample command for emulation:
```shell
powershell -Command "Start-Process 'exploit.exe' -ArgumentList '-i 1234'"
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not cover zero-day exploits or novel thread manipulation techniques.
  - Dynamic environments where baseline behavior constantly shifts could lead to missed detections.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes a stable baseline of normal thread execution patterns for anomaly detection.
  - Relies on comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities being enabled across the environment.

## False Positives

Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate software updates or patches that alter process behavior temporarily.
- Scheduled maintenance activities causing temporary spikes in resource usage.
- Misconfigured container orchestration tools leading to benign anomalies.

## Priority
**High**

The priority is high due to the severe implications of successful thread execution hijacking, which can lead to complete system compromise. This technique allows adversaries to bypass detection mechanisms and achieve persistence, making it critical to detect and mitigate promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with Windows nodes.
   - Configure monitoring tools such as Sysdig or Falco for real-time log analysis.

2. **Simulate Adversarial Behavior:**
   - Launch a container running a vulnerable service (e.g., an outdated web server).
   - Use a PowerShell script to inject malicious code into the process threads of this service.

3. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Observe logs for unexpected thread creation or termination.
   - Track network traffic for unusual patterns indicative of hijacked thread communication.
   - Verify file integrity checks for unauthorized modifications.

4. **Evaluate Detection Efficacy:**
   - Assess whether the monitoring tools flagged the emulated attack.
   - Adjust detection rules to minimize false positives while ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should promptly review logs and telemetry data to confirm the nature of the anomaly.
2. **Containment Measures:**
   - Isolate affected containers or nodes to prevent further spread.
   - Revert any unauthorized changes detected in system files.

3. **Post-Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the attack vector and impact.
   - Update detection rules and improve monitoring configurations based on findings.

4. **Communication:**
   - Notify relevant stakeholders about the incident and actions taken.
   - Document lessons learned for future reference and training purposes.
