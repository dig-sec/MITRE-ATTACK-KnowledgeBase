# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1056 - Input Capture
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection, Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Network  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources such as container logs, network traffic, and system call traces to identify suspicious patterns indicative of adversaries attempting to bypass security controls using containers. The key focus is on anomalous activities within containerized environments that resemble T1056 - Input Capture. This includes monitoring for unexpected inputs being captured or redirected by processes running in containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containers to capture sensitive input data (e.g., keystrokes, clipboard contents) as part of a broader espionage campaign. These actions are often concealed using techniques such as command injection or leveraging misconfigured containerized applications with elevated privileges.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Commands:** Use of `dd`, `strace`, or custom scripts to capture input data.
- **Test Scenarios:** Simulate an adversary setting up a container with tools capable of capturing inputs from host systems or other containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that monitoring is comprehensive across all relevant data sources.
- Potential blind spots include zero-day vulnerabilities in container orchestration platforms not covered by current signatures.
- Assumes adversaries are using common toolsets, which might miss novel or highly customized implementations.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of debugging tools within development environments.
- Input capture for authorized penetration testing activities.
- Automated scripts intended for system maintenance capturing temporary logs or inputs.

## Priority
**Priority Level: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant risk as it can lead to undetected data exfiltration and other malicious activities, potentially compromising sensitive organizational assets across various platforms.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
None available

## Response
When the alert fires:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine affected container instances to prevent further compromise.
2. **Incident Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine scope and impact, including data captured and potential exfiltration paths.
3. **Review Access Controls:** Examine container configurations and permissions to identify misconfigurations or excessive privileges.
4. **Forensic Examination:** Perform detailed forensic analysis on the host system and network traffic for additional clues.
