## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of log data from container orchestration platforms, network traffic analysis, and file integrity monitoring. By analyzing patterns in these data sources, the strategy aims to detect unusual behavior indicative of adversarial use of containers for deploying unauthorized web services.

### Data Sources Used:
- **Container Logs:** Captures events related to container creation, modification, and deletion.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitors inbound and outbound traffic from containers to identify unexpected communication patterns.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detects changes in critical files or configurations within the host system.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Unusual spikes in container deployment activities
- Unexpected network connections originating from containers
- Unauthorized modifications to system files or configurations

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to deploy web services for command and control (C2) purposes, evading traditional detection mechanisms. This approach allows them to quickly spin up isolated environments that can be easily discarded, minimizing their footprint on the host system.

### Execution in Real-World:
- **Container Orchestration Tools:** Adversaries might use tools like Docker or Kubernetes to deploy containers with embedded web services.
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run -d --name malicious-service -p 8080:80 my-malicious-image`
  - `kubectl apply -f malicious-deployment.yaml`

### Test Scenarios:
- Deploy a containerized service that attempts to communicate with an external C2 server on non-standard ports.
- Modify system configurations within the host using containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection might miss highly sophisticated adversaries who employ advanced evasion techniques such as encrypted traffic or domain generation algorithms (DGAs).
  - Limited visibility into encrypted container communication without additional network inspection capabilities.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has comprehensive logging and monitoring in place for containers, networks, and file systems.
  - Security teams have baseline knowledge of normal operations to distinguish anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use cases involving frequent deployment and teardown of containers for development or testing purposes.
- Authorized network communications from containerized applications using non-standard ports as part of their functionality.
- Routine configuration changes within the host system by system administrators.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the technique poses a significant threat, its detection is manageable with proper monitoring and logging. The risk can be mitigated through enhanced visibility and control over containerized environments.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no step-by-step instructions are available for adversary emulation in a test environment. However, organizations should consider creating controlled scenarios to validate the effectiveness of their detection strategy.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should review container logs and network traffic to understand the context of the alert.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers or nodes from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Analysis:** Determine if the detected activity is malicious by comparing it against known baselines and threat intelligence.
4. **Remediation:** Remove unauthorized containers, patch vulnerabilities, and update security policies as necessary.
