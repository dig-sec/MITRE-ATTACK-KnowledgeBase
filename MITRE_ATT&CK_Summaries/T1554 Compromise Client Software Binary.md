# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by using containers as a means of evasion or persistence on compromised hosts.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1554 - Compromise Client Software Binary
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1554)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring container activity across various platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) to identify suspicious behaviors indicative of adversarial attempts to evade security controls. Key data sources include:

- **System Logs:** Host logs related to container creation and execution.
- **Network Traffic:** Unusual outbound connections initiated by containers.
- **File Integrity Monitoring:** Changes in files or directories associated with container runtimes.

The strategy analyzes patterns such as:
- Creation of containers from unexpected locations.
- Execution of containers that perform suspicious network activities.
- Modifications to container runtime configurations or binaries.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may use containers to execute malicious code while bypassing traditional security monitoring. They often exploit containerization tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or Podman to create isolated environments where they can operate undetected. 

### Real-world Execution
In practice, adversaries might:
- Start a container from a compromised image.
- Use the container to download additional payloads.
- Execute commands inside the container that interact with external C2 servers.

#### Adversary Emulation Details

Sample Commands:
```bash
# Example Docker command for running a potentially malicious container
docker run --rm -d --net host evasive-container
```

Test Scenario:
1. Set up a container runtime environment.
2. Create a benign container image with modified files to simulate an adversary's payload.
3. Execute the container and monitor system logs, network traffic, and file changes.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Containers may be used in ways not covered by current monitoring rules.
  - Encrypted or obfuscated communication from containers might evade detection.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has robust logging enabled for container activities.
  - Security teams can correlate alerts across different data sources.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers in development environments.
- Temporary spikes in network traffic from containers due to routine operations (e.g., backups).
- Authorized changes to container configurations for maintenance purposes.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

Justification: Containers provide a powerful means for adversaries to persistently evade detection while maintaining command and control. The ability of an adversary to operate undetected within a compromised system poses significant security risks, necessitating high-priority monitoring and mitigation efforts.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Install Docker or another container runtime on the target host.
   
2. **Create Container Image:**
   - Build a benign image with slight modifications to simulate suspicious behavior.

3. **Execute Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d --net host evasive-container
   ```
   - Monitor and record system logs, network traffic, and file changes.
   
4. **Analyze Alerts:**
   - Verify if the detection strategy triggers alerts based on observed patterns.

## Response

When an alert fires indicating a potential adversarial use of containers:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement.
  - Initiate incident response protocols to assess the scope and impact.
  
- **Investigation Steps:**
  - Analyze container logs and network traffic for further clues about adversary actions.
  - Review file integrity reports for unauthorized modifications.

- **Remediation:**
  - Remove compromised containers and restore from clean backups if necessary.
  - Update security policies to prevent similar incidents.

Currently, no additional resources or references are available. Future updates may include detailed case studies or further integration with threat intelligence feeds.
