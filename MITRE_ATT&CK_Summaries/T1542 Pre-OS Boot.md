# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. By employing containerization, adversaries can mask their activities and evade traditional security controls.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1542 - Pre-OS Boot
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, Network

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing data from container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes), host logs, network traffic, and process activity to identify suspicious patterns indicative of misuse. Key indicators include unexpected changes in container configurations, anomalous communication between containers, and unusual resource usage.

Data sources used:
- Container orchestration platforms
- Host system logs
- Network traffic analysis tools
- Process monitoring solutions

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual scheduling or execution patterns within containers
- Anomalous network connections originating from containers
- Unexpected changes in container configurations or images

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to bypass security measures by executing malicious payloads within isolated environments, thus avoiding detection by traditional endpoint security tools. They might leverage container escape techniques to gain access to the host system or other containers.

Real-world execution often involves:
- Deploying a benign-looking container that performs malicious activities post-deployment
- Using rootkits to alter container behavior and hide processes

### Adversary Emulation Details
While specific sample commands may vary, adversaries might use tools like `docker` or `kubectl` for orchestration. An example scenario could involve:
1. Deploying a container with elevated privileges.
2. Modifying the container's configuration at runtime to connect back to C&C servers.
3. Using scripts to periodically change the containerâ€™s image hash to avoid detection.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all containers are monitored, which may not be true in highly dynamic environments.
- May miss novel techniques or configurations that have not been previously encountered.
- Relies on accurate configuration of monitoring tools and baseline activity patterns.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks altering container configurations.
- Scheduled maintenance operations resulting in unusual network traffic from containers.
- Software updates causing temporary spikes in resource usage.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
- Containers are increasingly used for legitimate purposes, making them attractive targets for adversaries.
- Successful bypass of security monitoring can lead to significant undetected activities within the environment.
- The ability to persist and evade detection poses a severe risk to organizational security.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no step-by-step instructions are available for emulating this technique in a test environment. However, organizations should consider setting up controlled environments with container orchestration platforms to simulate potential attack scenarios safely.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected containers and limit network access.
2. **Thorough Investigation:** Examine logs for unusual activities, configurations changes, or unauthorized access attempts.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify how adversaries gained initial access and what actions were performed within the container environment.
4. **Remediation:** Apply necessary patches, update security policies, and enhance monitoring capabilities to prevent recurrence.
5. **Communication:** Inform stakeholders of the incident, including potential data breaches or impacts on operations.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework and general container security guidelines. Organizations should consult up-to-date cybersecurity resources for evolving threat landscapes and best practices in container security.
