# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that utilize containers to bypass security monitoring mechanisms. This technique often involves adversaries using containers as a means to obscure their activities from traditional detection systems, potentially allowing them to execute malicious code or exfiltrate data undetected.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1560.002 - Archive via Library
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/002)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of log analysis and behavioral monitoring to identify suspicious container activity. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Network traffic logs
- File system changes

The strategy focuses on identifying anomalies such as unusual network connections from containers, unexpected file archiving activities using libraries like GZip or ZipFile, and irregular use of system resources.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit container technology due to its ability to isolate processes and applications. By deploying malicious code within a container, they can evade detection by traditional endpoint security solutions that may not be configured to monitor containerized environments effectively.

### Adversary Emulation Details

- **Sample Commands:**
  - Using Docker: `docker run --rm -v /path/to/archive:/mnt ubuntu tar czf /mnt/archive.tar.gz /sensitive/data`
  - Using Kubernetes Jobs: Deploying a job that creates archives of sensitive directories.

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Execute containerized applications with unusual network requests.
  - Observe the creation of large archive files within containers and their subsequent uploads to external locations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes comprehensive monitoring capabilities for both host and container environments are in place.
- May not detect adversaries using novel obfuscation techniques that evade signature-based detection.
- Relies on baseline activity profiles; significant deviations may be necessary to trigger alerts, potentially missing low-volume or slow-moving threats.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:

- Legitimate use of containerized applications for development and testing environments.
- Routine archiving of data by authorized personnel within a container environment.

To mitigate false positives, consider refining alert thresholds based on the specific operational context and normal activity patterns.

## Priority
**High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring poses significant risks as it can lead to undetected data exfiltration or lateral movement within an organization's network. Given the increasing adoption of containerization in enterprise environments, addressing this threat is critical.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Compressing Data using GZip in Python (FreeBSD/Linux):**
   ```python
   import gzip
   with open('data.txt', 'rb') as f_in:
       with gzip.open('data.gz', 'wb') as f_out:
           f_out.writelines(f_in)
   ```

2. **Compressing Data using bz2 in Python (FreeBSD/Linux):**
   ```python
   import bz2
   with open('data.txt', 'rb') as f_in:
       with bz2.open('data.bz2', 'wb') as f_out:
           f_out.writelines(f_in)
   ```

3. **Compressing Data using zipfile in Python (FreeBSD/Linux):**
   ```python
   import zipfile
   with open('data.txt', 'rb') as f:
       with zipfile.ZipFile('archive.zip', 'w') as zf:
           zf.writestr('data.txt', f.read())
   ```

4. **Compressing Data using tarfile in Python (FreeBSD/Linux):**
   ```python
   import tarfile
   with tarfile.open('archive.tar.gz', 'w:gz') as tf:
       tf.add('sensitive/data')
   ```

These scripts can be executed within a container to simulate adversarial behavior for testing detection mechanisms.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:

1. **Contain the Threat:** Isolate affected containers and networks to prevent further malicious activity.
2. **Investigate:** Analyze logs and network traffic associated with the suspicious container activity.
3. **Eradicate:** Remove malicious code or processes identified within the container environment.
4. **Recover:** Restore any affected systems to their pre-incident state, ensuring no backdoors remain.

This detection strategy provides a comprehensive approach to identifying and mitigating adversarial attempts to use containers for bypassing security monitoring. By focusing on both technical indicators and operational context, organizations can enhance their ability to detect and respond to such threats effectively.
