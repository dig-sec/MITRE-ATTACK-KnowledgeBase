# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Group Policy Preferences

## Goal

The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using the manipulation of Windows Group Policy Preferences (GPP) for credential access, specifically focusing on technique T1552.006.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1552.006 - Group Policy Preferences
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/006)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages event logs and file monitoring to identify unauthorized access or modification of Group Policy Preferences (GPP) files that may contain sensitive information, such as embedded passwords. The following data sources are utilized:

- **Event Logs:** Monitor for specific Event IDs related to GPO changes.
- **File System Monitoring:** Detect modifications in the SYSVOL folder where GPP files reside.

Patterns analyzed include unusual access times, modification of critical GPO files by unauthorized users, and patterns consistent with known adversary tactics such as using `findstr.exe` to extract passwords from GPP XML files.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit Group Policy Preferences by embedding credentials within the GPO XML files. In real-world scenarios, attackers use tools like `findstr.exe` or PowerShell scripts (`Get-GPPPassword`) to harvest these embedded credentials. Such techniques bypass traditional monitoring as they do not necessarily trigger antivirus alerts and can be executed with legitimate administrative tools.

### Adversary Emulation Details

- **Sample Commands:**
  - Using `findstr.exe`:  
    ```shell
    findstr /c:"<plaintext>" C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Scripts\*.xml
    ```
  - Using PowerShell (`Get-GPPPassword`):  
    ```powershell
    Get-GPPPassword -Path "C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Preferences\Registry\\*.xml"
    ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss encrypted GPO files or those located in non-standard directories.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that adversaries will use common methods to extract passwords from GPP XML files. Custom techniques may not be detected.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:

- Legitimate IT personnel performing routine maintenance on Group Policy settings.
- Scheduled scripts or tasks modifying GPO files for updates.
- Non-malicious third-party applications that read or modify GPO files.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

This technique poses a significant risk due to its potential for providing deep system access and bypassing traditional security measures. The ability of adversaries to extract sensitive credentials from GPP files can lead to widespread compromise if undetected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Test Environment:**
   - Ensure a controlled Windows domain with appropriate permissions to modify Group Policy Preferences.
   
2. **GPP Passwords Using `findstr.exe`:**

   ```shell
   findstr /c:"<plaintext>" C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Scripts\*.xml
   ```

3. **GPP Passwords Using PowerShell (`Get-GPPPassword`):**

   - Use the following script to extract passwords:
   
     ```powershell
     Import-Module GroupPolicy
     Get-GPPPassword -Path "C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine\Preferences\Registry\\*.xml"
     ```

4. **Monitor and Validate:**
   - Ensure detection alerts are triggered upon executing the above commands.
   - Verify logs for unauthorized access or changes to GPO files.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further exploitation.
2. **Investigate Logs:** Analyze event logs and file modifications in SYSVOL for signs of compromise.
3. **Assess Impact:** Determine if any credentials were extracted and assess potential data breaches or lateral movement.
4. **Remediate:** Remove unauthorized GPO files, reset compromised passwords, and update security policies to prevent recurrence.
