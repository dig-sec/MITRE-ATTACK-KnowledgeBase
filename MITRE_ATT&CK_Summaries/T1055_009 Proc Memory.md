# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containers on Linux platforms. This involves identifying suspicious activities where adversaries might utilize container processes to evade detection mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1055.009 - Proc Memory
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Linux
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/009)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activities that could indicate malicious behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- System process monitoring tools
- Network traffic analysis within containerized environments

Patterns analyzed involve unusual memory access patterns indicative of Process Memory techniques, such as accessing the `/proc` filesystem to manipulate or extract sensitive information.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may use containers to create isolated environments that evade traditional security controls. Techniques include:

- Accessing process memory via the `/proc` directory
- Manipulating container runtime configurations to obscure malicious activities
- Exploiting vulnerabilities within container orchestrators

Adversary emulation scenarios might involve executing commands like `cat /proc/<pid>/mem` within a container to read another process's memory, highlighting potential misuse.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

### Known Limitations:
- Detection may not cover all methods of accessing process memory.
- Assumes that container monitoring tools are properly configured and deployed.

### Assumptions:
- Adversaries will attempt to access process memory in ways detectable by the current setup.
- Containers are running on monitored hosts with sufficient logging enabled.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate debugging or forensic analysis using tools like `gdb` or `strace`.
- Routine system maintenance tasks that involve inspecting process memory for performance tuning.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification:
- Containers are widely used in modern IT environments, increasing the potential attack surface.
- Successful evasion can lead to significant breaches and data exfiltration if undetected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Setup a Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a containerized environment using Docker or Kubernetes on a Linux host.
   
2. **Emulate Adversarial Behavior:**
   - Run a benign container and start a separate process with identifiable characteristics (e.g., specific PID).
   - Use commands like `cat /proc/<pid>/mem` from within another container to mimic malicious memory access.

3. **Monitor for Alerts:**
   - Ensure monitoring tools are capturing relevant logs and events.
   - Verify that the system triggers alerts based on unusual process memory access patterns.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Review the context of the alert, including source containers and affected processes.
   - Confirm if the activity aligns with known benign operations or requires further investigation.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate suspicious containers to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Disable any unauthorized access points or configurations within the container runtime.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of logs and network traffic associated with the alert.
   - Identify the root cause and determine if additional indicators of compromise are present.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Patch vulnerabilities in container runtimes or orchestration tools.
   - Update security policies to prevent similar attempts in the future.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings and actions taken for organizational learning and compliance purposes.
