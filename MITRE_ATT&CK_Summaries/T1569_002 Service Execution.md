# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Service Execution via PsExec

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to execute commands on remote systems using services like PsExec, which may be used to bypass security monitoring by leveraging legitimate system tools for malicious purposes.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1569.002 - Service Execution
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** Windows

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring process execution and network activity for patterns indicative of PsExec usage. Key data sources include:
- Process creation logs (e.g., Sysmon events)
- Network traffic logs indicating unusual command-line tool usage
- File integrity checks on critical system directories

Patterns analyzed focus on the initiation of services like PsExec, especially when initiated from suspicious locations or with atypical user permissions.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use PsExec to execute commands remotely without establishing a traditional remote shell. This method is attractive due to its ability to evade basic detection mechanisms by mimicking legitimate administrative tasks.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** `psexec.exe \\targethost -u username -p password cmd`
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Execution of PsExec from non-standard directories.
  - Command execution with elevated privileges or modified user contexts.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes baseline knowledge of normal administrative behavior, which may vary across environments.
- Potential blind spots include detection evasion techniques such as using encrypted channels or altering PsExec binary signatures.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts:
- Legitimate use of PsExec by IT staff for remote troubleshooting.
- Scheduled tasks using PsExec without malicious intent.
- Use of containerized environments where PsExec-like tools are part of the application stack.

## Priority
**Severity: High**
Justification: Service execution techniques like PsExec can be used to establish persistence and facilitate lateral movement, significantly impacting network security posture.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Execute a Command as a Service**
   - Set up a service on the target machine that executes commands using PsExec.
   
2. **Use PsExec to Execute a Command on a Remote Host**
   - Run: `psexec.exe \\remotehost -u user -p password cmd`
   
3. **Psexec.py (Impacket)**
   - Use Impacket's psexec.py script for remote execution:
     ```bash
     python psexec.py \\target IP=10.0.0.5 -k -u username -p password cmd
     ```

4. **BlackCat Pre-encryption Commands with Lateral Movement**
   - Simulate lateral movement using PsExec in a pre-encryption scenario.
   
5. **Use RemCom to Execute a Command on a Remote Host**
   - Set up and test RemCom, ensuring detection captures remote execution events.

6. **Snake Malware Service Create**
   - Emulate Snake malware behavior by creating services that execute commands via PsExec.

7. **Modifying ACL of Service Control Manager via SDET**
   - Test scenarios where service access control lists are altered to permit unauthorized command execution.

8. **Pipe Creation - PsExec Tool Execution From Suspicious Locations**
   - Create pipes and execute PsExec from directories typically not used for system tools.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
- Verify the legitimacy of the process using context such as user permissions, source IP, and time of execution.
- Review recent changes to service configurations or access controls.
- Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
- Gather additional logs and evidence for further analysis.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently unavailable. Analysts should rely on up-to-date threat intelligence feeds and internal security protocols for comprehensive defense strategies.
