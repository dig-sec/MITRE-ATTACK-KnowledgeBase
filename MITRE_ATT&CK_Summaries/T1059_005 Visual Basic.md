# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Visual Basic Scripts

## **Goal**
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify and respond to adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using Visual Basic Scripting (VBS), specifically encoded scripts or those executed in memory, which are commonly employed by attackers.

## **Categorization**

## **Strategy Abstract**

The detection strategy involves monitoring for suspicious VBS activities across endpoints. Key data sources include process execution logs, PowerShell invocation histories, and memory dump analysis. Patterns of interest involve the use of encoded scripts, unusual command-line arguments indicating script obfuscation (e.g., `cscript` or `wscript` with Base64-encoded payloads), and unexpected parent-child process relationships involving VBS.

## **Technical Context**

Adversaries often employ Visual Basic Scripts due to their ability to execute commands quickly without user interaction. These scripts can be encoded, compressed, or packed to evade traditional detection mechanisms. Adversaries may utilize VBS for tasks like credential dumping, lateral movement, or downloading additional payloads from command-and-control servers.

### Common Techniques:
- **Encoded Script Execution:** Scripts are Base64-encoded and executed via `cscript` or `wscript`.
- **Memory Extraction:** Using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to extract sensitive information directly from memory.
  
**Sample Commands:**
```shell
cscript.exe //nologo "encoded_script.vbs"
```

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**

### Blind Spots:
- Limited visibility into encrypted or highly obfuscated scripts that do not exhibit typical execution patterns.
- Difficulty in distinguishing between benign encoded VBS scripts used for automation and malicious ones.

### Assumptions:
- Assumes a baseline of normal behavior to identify anomalies, which may vary significantly across different environments.

## **False Positives**

Potential false positives could include:

- Legitimate use of VBS by IT departments or administrators for system maintenance.
- Software that uses encoded scripts for licensing checks or configuration management tasks.

To mitigate false positives:
- Implement contextual analysis based on user roles and historical behavior patterns.
- Whitelisting known benign scripts after thorough review.

## **Priority**

**Severity:** High

**Justification:** Visual Basic Scripting can be a powerful tool in the hands of adversaries, capable of executing sophisticated attacks with low overhead. The ability to obfuscate commands makes it difficult for traditional defenses to detect malicious activity, necessitating proactive monitoring and detection strategies.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Prepare Test Environment:** Set up a controlled Windows-based environment isolated from production networks.
   
2. **Visual Basic Script Execution:**
   - Create a basic VBS script that gathers local computer information:
     ```vbscript
     Dim objWMIService, colItems, strComputer, objItem
     strComputer = "."
     Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")
     Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery("Select * from Win32_OperatingSystem")

     For Each objItem in colItems
         WScript.Echo "Caption: " & objItem.Caption
         WScript.Echo "CSName: " & objItem.CSName
     Next
     ```

3. **Encoded VBS Code Execution:**
   - Encode the script using Base64 and execute it with `cscript`:
     ```shell
     echo cscript.exe //nologo <Base64_encoded_script> | base64 -d > decoded.vbs
     cscript //nologo decoded.vbs
     ```

4. **Extract Memory via VBA:**
   - Write a simple VBA macro to access Windows memory:
     ```vba
     Sub ReadMemory()
         Dim objFSO, objFile
         Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
         Set objFile = objFSO.OpenTextFile("C:\temp\memory_dump.txt", 2)
         
         ' Simulate reading from memory (replace with actual logic if needed)
         objFile.WriteLine "Simulated memory read"
         objFile.Close
     End Sub
     ```

## **Response**

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Analysis:** Review the context of execution, including user activity logs and process relationships.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **Investigation:** Analyze memory dumps and script content for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
4. **Remediation:** Remove malicious scripts and restore systems from clean backups if necessary.
