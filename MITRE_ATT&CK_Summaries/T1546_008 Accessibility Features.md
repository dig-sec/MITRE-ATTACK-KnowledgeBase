# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## **Goal**
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that aim to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container environments, which are typically less scrutinized than traditional systems. This includes detecting unauthorized access and manipulation within these containers.

## **Categorization**

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Windows

## **Strategy Abstract**
The detection strategy focuses on identifying patterns indicative of adversarial activity within containerized environments. Key data sources include container logs, file integrity monitoring systems, and network traffic analysis. Patterns such as unusual modifications to accessibility features (like sticky keys), unexpected symbolic links, or unauthorized process debugging are analyzed.

## **Technical Context**

Adversaries often exploit container vulnerabilities due to their lightweight nature and the common perception of them being isolated environments. Techniques include:

- Debugging target processes within containers to inject malicious code.
- Modifying system binaries like `osk.exe` to execute arbitrary commands through symbolic links.
- Creating persistence by altering registry keys or leveraging accessibility features for backdoor access.

### Adversary Emulation Details
1. **Attach Command Prompt as a Debugger:** Use tools to attach debuggers to running processes within containers to gain deeper control.
2. **Replace Binary of Sticky Keys:** Modify the sticky keys binary to execute unauthorized commands when triggered.
3. **Create Symbolic Link From `osk.exe` to `cmd.exe`:** Establish links that redirect legitimate operations to malicious executables.

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- **Assumption:** All container activities are logged, which might not always be the case.
- **Limitation:** Detection may miss sophisticated techniques that operate below typical logging thresholds or mimic benign behavior.
- **Gaps:** Limited visibility into ephemeral containers or those managed by third-party orchestration tools.

## **False Positives**
Potential false positives include:

- Legitimate debugging operations performed during development or maintenance.
- Authorized modifications to accessibility features for compliance with accessibility standards.
- System administrators creating symbolic links for legitimate software management tasks.

## **Priority**
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used in critical infrastructure, making them attractive targets. The ability of adversaries to bypass monitoring and establish persistent access poses significant risks to security posture and data integrity.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**

To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Attach Command Prompt as a Debugger to Target Processes:**
   - Use `windbg` or similar tools to attach to processes within the container.
   
2. **Replace Binary of Sticky Keys:**
   - Modify `osk.exe` using a hex editor or script to inject malicious code.

3. **Create Symbolic Link From `osk.exe` to `cmd.exe`:**
   - Execute `mklink /D osk.exe cmd.exe` within the container environment.

4. **Execute Arbitrary Command via Registry Key:**
   - Use `reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\EnableLUA /v StubPath /t REG_SZ /d "cmd.exe"` to execute commands through registry manipulation.

5. **Auto-start Application on User Logon:**
   - Configure startup scripts or modify Windows Registry (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) within the container to ensure persistence of malicious applications.

## **Response**

When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. Isolate affected containers immediately to prevent lateral movement.
2. Review logs and changes made to binaries and symbolic links.
3. Assess the scope of impact by checking for similar modifications in other containers.
4. Update security policies to enhance monitoring and restrict unauthorized access.
