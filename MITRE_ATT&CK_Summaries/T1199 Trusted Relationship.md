# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging containerization technologies. These adversaries often exploit containers to conceal their activities, making it challenging for traditional security tools to detect malicious actions.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1199 - Trusted Relationship
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Initial Access
- **Platforms:** Windows, SaaS, IaaS, Linux, macOS

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy involves monitoring container activities across various platforms to identify suspicious behavior indicative of attempts to bypass security measures. The strategy leverages multiple data sources, including:

- **Container Logs:** Analyze logs for unusual or unauthorized container start-up and termination events.
- **Network Traffic:** Monitor network traffic patterns associated with containers to detect abnormal connections or data flows.
- **File System Activity:** Track file system changes within containers that may suggest tampering or data exfiltration attempts.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual container resource usage (CPU, memory).
- Unexpected inter-container communications.
- Changes in container configurations without proper authorization.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit the inherent isolation and flexibility of containers to bypass security monitoring. They might inject malicious code into legitimate containers or use containers as a staging area for further attacks. Common methods include:

- **Container Escape:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the host OS or container runtime to gain elevated privileges.
- **Malicious Image Deployment:** Deploying images containing hidden backdoors or malware.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In an emulation scenario, adversaries might use commands like:
```bash
docker run -d --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --security-opt=no-new-privileges <malicious-image>
```
This command runs a container with elevated network privileges but without additional privilege escalation capabilities due to security settings.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Limited visibility into encrypted or obfuscated data within containers.
  - Difficulty in distinguishing between benign and malicious use of legitimate container functionalities.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that all container activities are logged and accessible for analysis.
  - Relies on up-to-date threat intelligence to identify new evasion techniques.

## False Positives
Potential false positives may arise from:

- Legitimate DevOps activities involving rapid deployment and scaling of containers.
- Use of containers in development environments where unusual network traffic or resource usage is expected.
- Security tools themselves generating noise that mimics adversarial behavior (e.g., scanning tools running within containers).

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
- Containers are widely used across industries, making them a lucrative target for adversaries.
- Successful bypassing of security monitoring can lead to significant data breaches and infrastructure compromise.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should promptly investigate the container activity, focusing on the origin and purpose of the suspicious behavior.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers and halt any ongoing processes that may be malicious.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the breach.
4. **Mitigation:** Implement measures to prevent recurrence, such as patching vulnerabilities or enhancing container security policies.
