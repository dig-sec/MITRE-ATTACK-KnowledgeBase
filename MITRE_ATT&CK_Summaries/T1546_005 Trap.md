# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Use of `trap` for Persistence and Privilege Escalation on macOS and Linux

## **Goal**

The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that leverage the `trap` command in shell environments to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. This is achieved by circumventing normal process termination signals, allowing malicious scripts to continue executing even when interrupted.

## **Categorization**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1546.005 - Trap
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** macOS, Linux

## **Strategy Abstract**

This detection strategy involves monitoring shell environments for the use of the `trap` command to intercept signals like `EXIT`, `SIGINT`, and others. The focus is on detecting scripts that employ this technique to ensure continued execution, thereby evading standard security measures.

**Data Sources:**
- Shell history files (e.g., `.bash_history`)
- Audit logs capturing command executions
- Process monitoring tools

**Patterns Analyzed:**
- Usage of `trap` with specific signals such as `EXIT`, `SIGINT`
- Execution context indicating persistence or privilege elevation attempts

## **Technical Context**

Adversaries often use the `trap` command to catch termination signals in shell scripts. By doing so, they ensure that certain functions are executed upon script exit, allowing them to perform tasks like logging out of a session without terminating a running process or executing cleanup routines.

**Example Commands:**
- `trap 'echo "Exiting"; /bin/false' EXIT`
- `trap ':; exec $SHELL -i' SIGINT`

These commands can be used to maintain persistence by preventing scripts from exiting cleanly, thus avoiding detection and termination by security monitoring tools.

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**

- Detection relies heavily on the availability and integrity of shell history and audit logs.
- Assumes that adversaries use `trap` in a detectable manner; highly obfuscated or minimalistic uses may evade detection.
- Relies on the assumption that processes using `trap` are inherently suspicious, which might not always be the case.

## **False Positives**

Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate system scripts or administrative tasks using `trap` for error handling or cleanup operations.
- Users employing `trap` in development environments to manage debugging sessions.

## **Priority**

**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the use of `trap` by adversaries is not common, it represents a subtle method of maintaining persistence and evading detection. The impact can be significant if used effectively, but its rarity reduces the overall priority compared to more prevalent techniques.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**

To validate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Trap EXIT**
   - Execute: `trap 'echo "Exiting"; /bin/false' EXIT`
   - Verify that the script continues running despite attempts to terminate it using standard commands.

2. **Trap EXIT (freebsd)**
   - On FreeBSD systems, execute: `trap 'echo "Exiting BSD"; /bin/false' EXIT`
   - Confirm persistence under similar conditions as macOS/Linux.

3. **Trap SIGINT**
   - Execute: `trap ':; exec $SHELL -i' SIGINT`
   - Ensure the shell remains interactive and unaffected by interrupt signals.

4. **Trap SIGINT (freebsd)**
   - On FreeBSD systems, execute: `trap ':; exec $SHELL -i' SIGINT`
   - Check for consistent behavior with other Unix-like environments.

## **Response**

When an alert is triggered:
- Investigate the context of the detected `trap` usage.
- Determine if it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks or indicates malicious intent.
- Isolate and analyze affected systems to assess potential persistence mechanisms.
- Consider disabling or monitoring suspicious scripts for further actions.

## **Additional Resources**

For further understanding, refer to documentation on:
- Nohup Execution: Using `nohup` to run processes that ignore hangups.
- Shell scripting best practices related to signal handling.

This comprehensive strategy provides a framework for detecting and responding to adversarial use of the `trap` command in Unix-like environments.
