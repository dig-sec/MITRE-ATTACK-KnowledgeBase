# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring by utilizing container technologies.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1499.003 - Application Exhaustion Flood
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Impact
- **Platforms:** Windows, Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Google Workspace

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/003)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container deployments across various platforms to identify patterns indicative of adversarial use aimed at evading security measures. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- Network traffic associated with containers
- System resource utilization metrics

Patterns analyzed encompass abnormal spikes in application requests, unusual network communications from containerized applications, and discrepancies between expected and actual resource usage.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may deploy large numbers of containers to exhaust system resources or create noise that obfuscates malicious activities. By leveraging containerization's dynamic nature, adversaries can mask their actions within legitimate operational environments. Common execution techniques include:
- Over-provisioning of services in a distributed manner
- Use of microservices architecture for resilience against detection

Adversary emulation may involve deploying containers with configurations known to stress test systems or generate large volumes of benign traffic.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** The strategy assumes that all container orchestrators are equally monitored, which might not be the case in heterogeneous environments.
- **Assumptions:** It is assumed that adversaries aim for detectable resource exhaustion; however, some may employ more subtle methods that do not generate noticeable anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate spikes in traffic due to application scaling or promotional events
- Resource-intensive but authorized testing environments

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The use of containers for adversarial purposes can significantly impact system integrity and availability. Given the increasing adoption of container technologies, the potential for exploitation is substantial.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no publicly available step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment. Organizations should consider developing their own emulation scenarios based on known adversarial behaviors within their specific infrastructure context.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. Immediately isolate affected containers and review logs for suspicious activities.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation of network traffic originating from the containers.
3. Evaluate system resource usage patterns to identify deviations from normal behavior.
4. Implement additional monitoring controls if needed, focusing on high-risk container deployments.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no specific resources are available beyond general MITRE ATT&CK documentation and related security advisories for container technologies.
