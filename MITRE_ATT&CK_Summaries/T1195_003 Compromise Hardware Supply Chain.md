# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
Detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers by manipulating containerized environments on hosts.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1195.003 - Compromise Hardware Supply Chain
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Initial Access
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/003)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy aims to monitor for anomalous behaviors in containerized environments indicative of adversaries attempting to bypass security controls. Key data sources include host-level system logs, container runtime events (such as Docker or Kubernetes audit logs), and network traffic analysis. The patterns analyzed focus on unusual privilege escalations within containers, unexpected changes to critical files, and communication with suspicious external IP addresses.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may use containers to execute malicious payloads while avoiding detection by traditional endpoint security solutions. This can be achieved through techniques like:
- Privilege escalation within the container environment.
- Modifying or exploiting host system vulnerabilities from within a container.
- Leveraging container escape tactics to gain access to the host.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique, an adversary might use commands to exploit known vulnerabilities in container runtimes. For instance:
- Running containers with elevated privileges using flags like `--privileged` in Docker.
- Attempting to modify files on the host filesystem from within a container.
- Executing commands that facilitate container escape or unauthorized network access.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spot:** Detection might miss sophisticated evasion techniques that are designed specifically for the monitored environmentâ€™s configuration.
- **Assumption:** Host and container environments are configured to log events comprehensively and consistently across all platforms.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate system administrators or DevOps engineers performing necessary maintenance, such as modifying configurations or escalating privileges temporarily for debugging purposes.
- Network traffic from trusted external services that might appear unusual under normal circumstances but are expected during specific operations (e.g., software updates).

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: This technique can potentially lead to a full system compromise if adversaries successfully exploit container environments to gain host-level access, thereby bypassing traditional security measures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no step-by-step instructions for adversary emulation are available. Developing these would involve creating controlled test scenarios that safely replicate the exploitation of container vulnerabilities without risking production systems.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected containers and hosts from the network to prevent further lateral movement.
2. **Investigation:** Analyze logs to determine the nature and scope of the activity, focusing on privilege escalations or unauthorized access attempts.
3. **Mitigation:** Apply necessary patches or configuration changes to mitigate vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.
4. **Forensics:** Collect evidence for a deeper investigation into how the breach occurred and document findings.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional resources are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework reference provided in this report. Further research and industry collaboration may uncover more comprehensive guidelines or tools specific to container security.
