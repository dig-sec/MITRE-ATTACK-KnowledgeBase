# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves identifying unauthorized or suspicious activities that leverage container technology to evade traditional detection mechanisms.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy utilizes a combination of log analysis, network traffic monitoring, and container-specific data sources to identify patterns indicative of malicious activity. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Monitoring for unusual or unauthorized actions within containers.
- **Network Traffic:** Analyzing ingress and egress traffic related to containers for anomalies.
- **System Calls:** Observing system call patterns that deviate from normal behavior.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual network connections initiated by container processes.
- Unexpected changes in container configurations or images.
- Anomalous resource usage spikes within containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to isolate malicious activities, making detection more challenging. They might deploy unauthorized containers, modify existing ones, or exploit vulnerabilities within the container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes) to maintain persistence and evade detection.

### Real-world Execution
- **Container Deployment:** Adversaries may deploy containers with compromised images.
- **Configuration Changes:** Unauthorized changes to network settings or resource limits.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Using containers to exfiltrate data without triggering traditional security alerts.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Dynamic Environments:** Rapidly changing environments can lead to false negatives if detection systems are not updated frequently.
- **Sophisticated Evasion Techniques:** Advanced adversaries may use sophisticated methods that are difficult to detect with standard patterns.
- **Assumption of Normal Behavior:** Assumes baseline knowledge of normal container behavior, which may vary significantly across organizations.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate updates or changes to container configurations.
- Authorized deployment of new containers for testing purposes.
- Network traffic from known and trusted sources interacting with containers.

## Priority
**High.** Containers are increasingly used in modern IT environments, making them attractive targets for adversaries looking to bypass security controls. The ability to detect such attempts is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of organizational assets.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should quickly assess the nature of the detected activity.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine if the activity is malicious or benign by reviewing logs and configurations.
4. **Remediation:** Apply necessary fixes, such as patching vulnerabilities or updating configurations.
5. **Documentation:** Record findings and response actions for future reference and improvement of detection strategies.
