# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report: OS Exhaustion Flood (T1499.001)

## Goal
This detection technique aims to identify adversarial attempts to execute an Operating System Exhaustion Flood attack. The objective is to detect activities that exploit the limitations of system resources, causing denial-of-service or disrupting normal operations.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1499.001 - OS Exhaustion Flood
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Impact
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/001)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring system-level metrics and logs to identify patterns indicative of an OS Exhaustion Flood. Key data sources include:

- **System Logs:** Analyze for abnormal CPU, memory, disk I/O, or network usage.
- **Performance Counters:** Monitor resource consumption metrics.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Detect unusual spikes in traffic that could indicate exhaustion attempts.

Patterns to be analyzed involve sustained high resource usage and irregular system behavior not attributable to normal operations. Thresholds and anomaly detection algorithms can help flag potential incidents.

## Technical Context

Adversaries execute OS Exhaustion Flood attacks by leveraging malicious scripts or applications designed to consume significant system resources. This can include:

- **Resource Hogs:** Programs that open numerous processes or threads.
- **Fork Bomb:** A specific form of attack where a process repeatedly replicates itself, consuming CPU and memory.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Linux/macOS:** 
   - Use `yes > /dev/null &` to simulate high CPU usage.
   - Create fork bombs: `:(){ :|:& };:` (Note: Do not run on production systems).

2. **Windows:**
   - Open multiple instances of resource-intensive applications like command prompt or PowerShell with heavy operations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss stealthy attacks that gradually increase resource usage.
  - Complex multi-stage attacks might evade detection if they spread their impact over time.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Baseline normal behavior is well-defined for accurate anomaly detection.
  - System resources are monitored continuously and comprehensively.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:

- Legitimate applications undergoing unexpected resource spikes due to updates or new features.
- Scheduled tasks like backups, indexing, or system scans that temporarily consume high resources.
- User behavior anomalies (e.g., running multiple virtual machines simultaneously).

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification: OS Exhaustion Flood attacks can lead to significant service disruptions and data loss. The potential impact on business continuity justifies a high priority for detection and response.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Step-by-step instructions are currently not available. However, the approach involves:

1. Setting up controlled environments with representative workloads.
2. Running resource-intensive scripts to simulate attack conditions.
3. Monitoring system metrics to validate alert triggers.

## Response

Guidelines for analysts when an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Analysis:** Verify if high resource usage aligns with any scheduled tasks or known benign activities.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent further impact.
3. **Root Cause Identification:** Determine the source of unusual activity, distinguishing between malicious and non-malicious causes.
4. **Remediation:** Implement necessary fixes, such as adjusting resource limits or terminating rogue processes.
5. **Post-Incident Review:** Update detection parameters based on findings to reduce future false positives.

## Additional Resources

Additional references and context are not available at this time. Analysts should rely on organizational incident response playbooks and industry best practices for further guidance.
