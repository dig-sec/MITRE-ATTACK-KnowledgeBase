# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Windows Remote Management

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using Windows Remote Management (WinRM). This involves identifying lateral movement activities where adversaries exploit WinRM to execute commands on remote systems, potentially leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1021.006 - Windows Remote Management
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring WinRM traffic for unusual patterns indicative of adversarial activity. Key data sources include network traffic logs, endpoint event logs, and security information from host-based intrusion prevention systems (HIPS). The strategy involves analyzing:
- Uncommon or unauthorized remote management sessions.
- Anomalous command execution via `Invoke-Command`.
- Suspicious WinRM listener configurations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often leverage Windows Remote Management to execute commands on compromised machines without direct access. This technique allows them to move laterally within a network by executing PowerShell scripts, potentially bypassing traditional security monitoring tools that do not inspect encrypted or legitimate management traffic thoroughly.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:** Use of `Invoke-Command` with stolen credentials.
- **Test Scenarios:** Configuring WinRM listeners to accept remote requests and simulating lateral movement using PowerShell scripts executed over these sessions.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Known Limitations:**
  - Detection may not cover encrypted traffic where malicious payload is embedded in legitimate management data.
  - Systems with default or non-standard configurations might exhibit benign anomalies that mimic adversarial behavior.
- **Assumptions:**
  - WinRM is used for lateral movement; hence, monitoring focuses on this vector rather than other potential methods like SMB exploits.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate administrative activities using PowerShell remoting or remote management tools under normal operational procedures.
- Network segmentation changes that introduce new patterns of legitimate remote access.

## Priority
**Severity: High**
Justification: The ability to execute commands remotely via WinRM can lead to significant security breaches, including data exfiltration and further network compromise. The high priority reflects the potential impact and stealthiness of such attacks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Enable Windows Remote Management:**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator.
   - Execute: `winrm quickconfig`
   - Confirm configuration with: `winrm enumerate winrs`

2. **Remote Code Execution Using Invoke-Command:**
   - On the target machine, ensure PowerShell remoting is enabled:
     ```
     Enable-PSRemoting -Force
     Set-Item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts *
     ```
   - From a compromised system or an attacker-controlled machine within the network, execute:
     ```
     Invoke-Command -ComputerName TargetMachineName -ScriptBlock { Get-Process }
     ```

3. **WinRM Access with Evil-WinRM:**
   - Use Evil-WinRM to interactively exploit WinRM vulnerabilities:
     ```
     evil-winrm -i TargetMachineIP -u Username -p Password
     ```

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate the affected systems from the network.
- Review logs for unauthorized access attempts and command executions.
- Verify credentials used in suspicious sessions against known administrative accounts.
- Assess whether any data exfiltration or further compromise occurred.
- Implement remediation steps such as patching vulnerabilities, resetting compromised credentials, and enhancing monitoring rules.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are not available at this time. Analysts should refer to internal security policies and threat intelligence sources for guidance on handling detected WinRM-based lateral movement activities.
