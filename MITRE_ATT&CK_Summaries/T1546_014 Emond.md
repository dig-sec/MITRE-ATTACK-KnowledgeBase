# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using the `eventmonitor` tool on macOS systems. Specifically, it focuses on identifying unauthorized creation and use of event monitors that could be leveraged for persistence or privilege escalation.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1546.014 - Emond
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/014)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring for unauthorized creation of event monitors using the `eventmonitor` command. Data sources include system logs and process monitoring tools that can capture the execution of this specific command. The primary pattern analyzed is the unexpected or unauthorized invocation of `eventmonitor`, which could indicate adversarial activity.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use the `eventmonitor` tool on macOS to create event monitors, allowing them to execute arbitrary code in response to system events. This can be used for persistence by maintaining a foothold after initial access or for privilege escalation by executing privileged operations under certain conditions.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Command:** 
  ```bash
  /usr/bin/eventmonitor -w "com.apple.loginwindow:CGSessionStateChanged" \
    -a "/path/to/malicious/script.sh"
  ```
- **Test Scenario:** 
  An adversary gains initial access and executes the above command to set up an event monitor that triggers a malicious script when a user logs in.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection assumes that all legitimate uses of `eventmonitor` are authorized, which may not always be the case.
- It does not account for adversaries using alternative methods to achieve similar persistence or privilege escalation without invoking `eventmonitor`.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of `eventmonitor` by system administrators for monitoring purposes.
- Scheduled tasks that involve legitimate event monitors set up during regular maintenance.

## Priority
**Priority:** High  
**Justification:** The potential impact of adversaries using `eventmonitor` to maintain persistence or escalate privileges is significant, as it can lead to prolonged unauthorized access and increased control over the system.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Ensure a macOS environment with appropriate permissions.
2. **Execute Event Monitor Command:**
   ```bash
   /usr/bin/eventmonitor -w "com.apple.loginwindow:CGSessionStateChanged" \
     -a "/path/to/test_script.sh"
   ```
3. **Observe System Logs:**
   - Check system logs for entries related to the creation of event monitors.
4. **Trigger Event Monitor:**
   - Log out and log back in to trigger the event monitor.
5. **Verify Execution:**
   - Ensure `/path/to/test_script.sh` is executed as expected.

## Response
When an alert indicating unauthorized use of `eventmonitor` fires, analysts should:
- Immediately investigate the source and context of the command execution.
- Review system logs for related activities or anomalies.
- Revoke any unauthorized event monitors found.
- Assess the potential impact on system integrity and security posture.
- Update incident response plans to prevent future occurrences.
