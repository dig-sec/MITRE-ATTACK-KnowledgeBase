# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of Containerization to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using container technologies. This includes identifying unauthorized deployment and use of containers that may be leveraged by adversaries to obscure malicious activities or exfiltrate data.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy involves monitoring for suspicious activities related to container deployments and operations. Key data sources include system logs (e.g., Docker or Kubernetes events), network traffic, file integrity monitoring systems, and endpoint detection and response tools.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual creation or modification of containers.
- Containers with non-standard configurations.
- Unexpected inter-container communication patterns.
- Network connections to uncommon ports from container hosts.

The strategy leverages anomaly detection and baseline deviations within a defined security perimeter to identify potential misuse.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containerization technology to obfuscate command execution, data exfiltration, or lateral movement. This is often achieved by:
- Deploying containers without proper logging.
- Using containers as pivot points for network access.
- Manipulating container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to create backdoors.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries might employ tools such as `docker`, `kubectl`, or custom scripts to deploy and manage these containers stealthily. Commands may include creating new container images with embedded payloads or modifying existing configurations to bypass detection mechanisms.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes a baseline of normal behavior for container operations within the environment.
- May not detect entirely covert implementations that mimic legitimate container activities.
- Limited in environments where container usage is highly dynamic, leading to frequent false positives due to legitimate changes.
  
## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment of new containers as part of development pipelines.
- Routine updates or scaling operations within containerized applications.
- Automated testing processes that use container technology.

False positives may also arise from misconfigured monitoring rules or insufficient baseline data for what constitutes "normal" activity.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification:
- While containerization is a powerful tool for both legitimate and malicious purposes, the potential impact depends on how itâ€™s exploited. Detection of unauthorized containers can prevent initial access or lateral movement by adversaries but may not always indicate an imminent threat if misconfigurations are present.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
No specific emulation instructions available at this time. However, organizations should consider setting up a controlled environment to simulate potential adversarial behaviors related to container misuse and refine detection mechanisms accordingly.

## Response
When alerts indicating suspicious container activity fire:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Analyze logs from the container orchestration platform.
   - Review network traffic associated with the containers in question.
   - Assess file integrity reports for changes within the host systems running these containers.

2. **Containment and Mitigation:**
   - Isolate any suspicious containers or hosts to prevent further potential impact.
   - Conduct a detailed audit of all containerized environments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

3. **Post-Incident Analysis:**
   - Document findings, including the nature of the threat and steps taken.
   - Update detection rules to improve future response efficiency.

4. **Communication:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders about the incident and any potential data or service impacts.
