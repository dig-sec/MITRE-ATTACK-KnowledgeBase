# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using container technologies. This strategy aims to identify and alert on actions that adversaries may take to exploit containers as a method for evading detection by traditional security systems.

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on identifying patterns and anomalies associated with the misuse of container technologies to bypass security monitoring. The approach utilizes data sources such as:

- **Container Logs:** Monitoring for unusual activity in container orchestration systems like Kubernetes, Docker.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identifying abnormal communication patterns between containers and external networks.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detecting unauthorized changes within container images or filesystems.

The strategy analyzes behavioral patterns that deviate from the norm, such as unexpected file modifications, unusual network traffic originating from containers, and anomalous use of container orchestrators.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may attempt to exploit container technologies by:

- **Compromising Container Images:** Inserting malicious code into images before they are deployed.
- **Exploiting Orchestration Tools:** Using vulnerabilities in Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to gain unauthorized access.
- **Using Containers for Command and Control (C2):** Setting up covert communication channels through containers.

Real-world execution might involve adversaries using tools like `kubectl` to modify container configurations or deploying malicious images that bypass security controls. 

### Adversary Emulation Details
While specific commands may vary, adversaries might use:
- `docker build -t malicious_image .` to create and push a compromised image.
- `kubectl exec <pod> -- <malicious_command>` to execute arbitrary commands within containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

### Known Limitations:
- Detection strategies may not cover all forms of sophisticated container abuse due to the complexity and variety in container configurations.
- Dependencies on the accuracy and completeness of logging from container orchestration platforms.

### Assumptions:
- Container environments are properly configured with monitoring and logging enabled.
- Security controls are up-to-date and capable of detecting known threats within containers.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate updates to container images that involve changes in code or dependencies.
- Network traffic patterns associated with normal operational processes, such as microservices communication.

## Priority

**Severity Assessment: High**

Justification:
Container-based environments are increasingly used for deploying applications at scale. The ability of adversaries to exploit these environments can lead to significant breaches, making it imperative to prioritize detection and mitigation efforts.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions
None available.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Assessment:** Verify the legitimacy of the alert by reviewing logs and network traffic associated with the container.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
3. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and nature of the breach, including reviewing recent changes in container images or configurations.
4. **Remediation:** Apply necessary patches or updates to secure vulnerabilities and restore normal operations.
5. **Post-Incident Review:** Analyze the incident to improve detection strategies and response plans for future incidents.
