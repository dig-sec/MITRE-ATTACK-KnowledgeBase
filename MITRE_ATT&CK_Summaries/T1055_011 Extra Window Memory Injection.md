# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Extra Window Memory Injection on Windows

## Goal

The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to inject malicious payloads into applications running on Windows systems using the Extra Window Memory (EWM) injection technique. This method typically aims at bypassing security monitoring and gaining unauthorized access or escalating privileges.

## Strategy Abstract

This strategy leverages the analysis of process memory and window messages to detect attempts at Extra Window Memory Injection. By monitoring both suspicious processes that might be injecting payloads and those that are being targeted, we can identify abnormal patterns indicative of an attack. The following data sources are used in this detection strategy:

- **Process Monitoring:** Observing unusual parent-child relationships between processes.
- **Memory Analysis:** Identifying unexpected memory allocations or modifications within the memory space of known applications.
- **Window Message Tracking:** Detecting anomalous window messages that could be indicative of an injection attempt.

Patterns analyzed include unexpected interactions between processes, unexplained changes in process memory structures, and unusual sequences of window messages directed to vulnerable applications.

## Technical Context

Adversaries use Extra Window Memory Injection primarily for its stealth capabilities. This technique involves writing malicious code into the extra window memory buffer associated with legitimate processes, which can then be executed by those processes. This method is favored because it avoids many traditional detection mechanisms that focus on DLL injection or process spawning.

### Adversary Emulation Details

In a real-world scenario, attackers might execute commands like:
```shell
echo "malicious_payload" > %temp%\ewm_injection.bin
rundll32.exe user32.dll,CreateMutexA -n ewm_mutex -d "%temp%\ewm_injection.bin"
```

Test scenarios include creating test applications that emulate vulnerable Windows components and observing their memory for unauthorized access or modifications.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Advanced obfuscation techniques used by adversaries can hinder detection.
  - Low-volume, targeted attacks may not trigger alerts due to threshold settings.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The target environment uses logging and monitoring systems capable of capturing the necessary data (process interactions, memory usage, window messages).
  - Baseline behaviors for processes and applications are well-defined.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might result in false positives include:

- Legitimate software updates or installations that alter process memory.
- Developer testing involving manual injection of code into application memory for debugging purposes.
- Automated scripts used by IT administrators for maintenance tasks that interact with application windows.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

This technique poses a significant threat due to its ability to bypass conventional security measures and facilitate unauthorized access or escalation. The high priority reflects the potential impact on sensitive systems and data integrity, especially within enterprise environments where such techniques could be used to exfiltrate confidential information.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Steps to Emulate Extra Window Memory Injection

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Prepare a Windows environment with monitoring tools enabled.
   - Ensure that both application and system-level logging are active.

2. **Create Vulnerable Application:**
   - Develop or use an existing Windows application known for handling window messages (e.g., notepad.exe).

3. **Prepare Malicious Payload:**
   - Write a benign piece of code intended to mimic malicious behavior, e.g., displaying a message box.
   - Save the payload in a temporary file.

4. **Execute Injection Command:**
   ```shell
   echo "malicious_payload" > %temp%\ewm_injection.bin
   rundll32.exe user32.dll,CreateMutexA -n ewm_mutex -d "%temp%\ewm_injection.bin"
   ```

5. **Observe and Record Anomalies:**
   - Monitor for unexpected interactions between the vulnerable application and other processes.
   - Check memory dumps for unauthorized code or data in application memory space.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Investigate the Source:**
   - Determine the origin of the injection attempt, including reviewing logs for suspicious activities and commands executed.

3. **Eradicate Threats:**
   - Remove injected payloads from memory and terminate any malicious processes identified during the investigation.

4. **Recovery Actions:**
   - Restore affected systems to a known good state using backups.
   - Update security configurations to prevent recurrence, such as adjusting monitoring thresholds or enhancing logging detail.

5. **Post-Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough analysis to identify how the attack was carried out and any gaps in current defense mechanisms.
   - Implement additional controls based on findings, including enhanced memory scanning capabilities or stricter process access policies.
