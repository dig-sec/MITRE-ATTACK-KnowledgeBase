# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers by establishing one-way communication channels that can evade traditional detection mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages network traffic analysis, container monitoring logs, and endpoint telemetry to identify patterns indicative of one-way communication channels. By analyzing outbound connections from containers that do not correspond with expected application behavior or inbound responses, the system can flag potential adversarial activities.

### Data Sources Used:
- **Network Traffic Logs:** Monitoring for unusual outbound connection attempts without corresponding inbound traffic.
- **Container Runtime Logs:** Observing unexpected behaviors or unauthorized modifications in container configurations.
- **Endpoint Telemetry:** Checking for anomalous processes or command executions that correlate with suspicious network activity.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may utilize containers to create covert communication channels by manipulating container configurations and orchestrations. They often execute commands like:

```bash
docker run -d --name secret_comm -p 8080:80 my_image
```

This command could establish a service listening on port 8080 without expected inbound traffic, potentially indicating an attempt at one-way communication.

### Adversary Emulation:
Adversaries might use tools such as `kubectl exec` to inject malicious scripts into running containers or configure sidecar proxies that facilitate covert outbound communications.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into encrypted network traffic can hinder the detection of one-way communication. Additionally, legitimate applications using ephemeral ports for communication may be misidentified as adversarial.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that containers are monitored continuously and that baselines for normal application behavior have been established.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate services running in containers that communicate over the internet without inbound connections, such as telemetry agents or logging services.
- Temporary network misconfigurations leading to unusual outbound traffic patterns during updates or maintenance.

## Priority
**High**: This technique poses a significant threat as it allows adversaries to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data undetected. The ability to bypass traditional monitoring tools can severely compromise an organization's security posture.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Set Up Test Environment:** Deploy a containerized application with network logging enabled.
2. **Emulate Adversarial Activity:**
   - Run the following command to create a suspicious container:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name test_container -p 9999:80 alpine sleep infinity
     ```
   - Execute a script within the container that mimics one-way communication, such as sending periodic HTTP requests without expecting responses.
3. **Monitor and Analyze:** Use network traffic analysis tools to detect outbound connections from `test_container` with no corresponding inbound traffic.

## Response
When an alert for potential one-way communication is triggered:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Cross-reference the flagged activity with known application behaviors and scheduled tasks.
2. **Isolate the Container:** If suspicious, isolate the container to prevent further network activity.
3. **Investigate Network Traffic:** Analyze outbound connections for patterns indicative of data exfiltration or command and control communication.
4. **Review Logs:** Examine container runtime logs and endpoint telemetry for any additional signs of compromise.
