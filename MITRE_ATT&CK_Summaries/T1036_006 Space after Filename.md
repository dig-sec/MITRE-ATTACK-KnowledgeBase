# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring by leveraging containers with filenames that contain spaces after the actual filename. This strategy addresses defense evasion tactics used on Linux and macOS platforms.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying and analyzing patterns in filenames that contain spaces after the main file name. This is achieved by monitoring filesystem activities across containers running on Linux or macOS environments. Data sources such as audit logs, system logs, and container runtime logs are leveraged to detect anomalies.

Key patterns include:
- Filenames with unexpected trailing spaces.
- Unusual changes in directory structures within containers.
- File creation events that don't match typical application behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit the space-after-filename technique as part of their defense evasion strategy. By creating files with a name followed by a space (e.g., `importantfile .bash_history`), they can mislead security tools into overlooking these files due to variations in how filenames are processed.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In a controlled environment, the following command can be used to test this technique:

```sh
touch importantfile .bash_history  # Create a file with space after its name
ls -la                             # Verify the creation of the hidden file
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may fail if logs are not comprehensive or are inadequately configured.
  - Techniques that alter log configurations to suppress evidence may remain undetected.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Logs from all relevant sources (system, audit, container runtime) are available and properly synchronized.
  - The system is capable of capturing all file creation events within the containers.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of filenames with spaces by users unaware of security implications.
- Automated processes or scripts intentionally using filenames with trailing spaces for non-malicious purposes, such as versioning or specific formatting requirements.

## Priority
**Priority Level: Medium**

Justification: While the space-after-filename technique is a known evasion tactic, its impact depends on the broader context of an adversary's activities. It is a valuable indicator when combined with other signals but should not be overemphasized in isolation due to potential false positives and common benign use cases.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

### Space After Filename (Manual)

1. **Create Test Environment:**
   - Set up a Linux or macOS system with container support (e.g., Docker).
   - Ensure logging is enabled for file system activities.

2. **Execute Adversarial Command:**
   ```sh
   docker run --rm -it alpine sh  # Start an Alpine container with interactive shell
   touch importantfile .hiddenfile  # Create a hidden file
   ls -la                          # Verify creation in the list
   ```

3. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Check system and Docker logs for file creation events.
   - Confirm detection of the filename anomaly.

### Space After Filename

1. **Automate Detection Script:**
   - Develop a script that scans container logs for filenames with trailing spaces.
   - Implement alerting mechanisms upon detecting such patterns.

2. **Test Script in Environment:**
   - Run the script against historical log data to validate accuracy and sensitivity.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should verify if the file creation aligns with known legitimate activities or scripts.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Examine container configurations, recent user activity, and process histories for signs of unauthorized access or behavior.
3. **Containment:** If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate affected containers and initiate remediation procedures to prevent further exploitation.
