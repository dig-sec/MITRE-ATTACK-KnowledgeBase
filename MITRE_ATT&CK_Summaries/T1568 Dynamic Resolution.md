## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers.

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on monitoring container usage to identify potential adversarial activities aimed at bypassing security measures. The primary data sources include:

- Container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- Network traffic logs
- System event logs
- Process execution and file system activity logs

Patterns analyzed include unusual or unauthorized container deployments, unexpected network communications from containers, anomalous process behaviors within containers, and file changes that may indicate malicious activities.

---

## Technical Context

Adversaries use dynamic resolution techniques to manipulate DNS queries and other lookup mechanisms to hide command-and-control (C2) servers. In the context of containerized environments, adversaries might deploy containers dynamically to evade detection by traditional security tools. They leverage legitimate orchestration systems to mask their intentions and maintain persistence.

**Real-World Execution:**
Adversaries often use scripts or orchestrated workflows to automate the deployment of malicious containers. These containers might mimic legitimate services but serve as a front for C2 communication or other nefarious activities.

**Sample Commands/Test Scenarios:**

- Deploying Docker containers with commands like:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name malware-container mymalwareimage
  ```

- Kubernetes deployment YAML configurations that schedule malicious workloads:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: malicious-deployment
  spec:
    replicas: 3
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: malware
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: malware-container
          image: mymalwareimage
  ```

---

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not cover encrypted communications within or between containers.
  - Obfuscation techniques used by adversaries to disguise container activities might evade pattern recognition.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Containers are managed through observable orchestration systems.
  - Network traffic and logs are adequately monitored and captured for analysis.

---

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate deployment of new or updated containers as part of standard operational procedures.
- Automated container management tasks by DevOps teams, such as scaling operations or updates.
- Testing environments where developers deploy containers to simulate production scenarios.

---

## Priority

**Severity:** High

Justification: The use of containers for adversarial purposes represents a sophisticated attack vector that can significantly undermine security monitoring and response efforts. Containers provide adversaries with the ability to dynamically evade detection, making it crucial to prioritize this threat in detection strategies.

---

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, none available. Future plans may include developing controlled test scenarios to better understand and validate detection capabilities against container-based dynamic resolution techniques.

---

## Response

When an alert is triggered by this strategy:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected containers from the network.
   - Halt any suspicious or unauthorized containers.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review container logs, including deployment scripts and runtime activities.
   - Analyze network traffic originating from the containers for signs of C2 communication.

3. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Remove malicious containers and clean affected systems.
   - Update security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings, including indicators of compromise (IOCs) and remedial actions taken.
   - Share information with relevant stakeholders and possibly threat intelligence communities.

Currently, no additional resources are available. Future updates may include detailed case studies, academic papers, or industry reports that provide further insights into container-based adversarial techniques.
