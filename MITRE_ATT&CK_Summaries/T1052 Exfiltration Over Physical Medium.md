# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. This involves identifying scenarios where adversaries use containers as a method for exfiltrating data or executing malicious activities undetected.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1052 - Exfiltration Over Physical Medium
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Exfiltration
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activities that deviate from typical usage patterns. It involves the collection and analysis of log data from container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes), host systems, and network traffic to identify anomalies indicative of adversarial behavior.

**Data Sources:**
- Container orchestration logs (Kubernetes audit logs)
- Host-level system logs
- Network flow data

**Patterns Analyzed:**
- Unexpected communication between containers and external IPs
- Large volume data transfers through containerized applications
- Creation or modification of containers without proper authorization or documentation

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containers to bypass security monitoring by packaging malicious payloads within legitimate-looking container images. They might use these containers for various purposes, including data exfiltration, command-and-control communications, and deploying malware on target systems.

**Execution in the Real World:**
- Building custom Docker images with embedded tools or data exfiltration scripts.
- Leveraging orchestration features to create ephemeral containers that can be rapidly spun up and destroyed after use, making detection difficult.
- Using containerized applications as a fa√ßade for executing command-and-control activities.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- Creating a Docker image with an embedded payload.
  ```bash
  docker build -t malicious_image .
  ```
- Running the container to initiate data exfiltration or execute commands:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -d malicious_image
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Encrypted network traffic from containers may hinder detection of malicious communication.
  - Highly sophisticated adversaries might employ advanced evasion techniques that are not captured by current monitoring systems.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Organizations maintain comprehensive logging for container orchestrators, hosts, and network traffic.
  - Baselines of normal behavior have been established to effectively identify deviations indicative of adversarial activity.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate data transfer operations within a containerized environment that match the pattern of exfiltration.
- Routine administrative tasks involving creation, modification, or deletion of containers.
- Network traffic spikes due to regular business processes or software updates.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability of adversaries to use containers for covert activities poses a significant risk. Containers are increasingly prevalent in modern IT environments, and their misuse can lead to substantial data breaches or operational disruptions.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Set Up Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or kind.
   - Ensure logging is enabled for all components.

2. **Create Malicious Container Image:**
   ```bash
   FROM ubuntu:latest
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
   ADD exfiltration_script.sh /usr/local/bin/
   ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "/usr/local/bin/exfiltration_script.sh"]
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Malicious Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t malicious_image .
   docker run --rm -d malicious_image
   ```

4. **Monitor Logs and Network Traffic:**
   - Check Kubernetes audit logs for unusual container activity.
   - Analyze host system logs for unexpected processes or file modifications.
   - Use network monitoring tools to identify anomalous traffic patterns.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential adversarial use of containers:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate affected containers and hosts from the network.
   - Preserve relevant logs and evidence for forensic analysis.
   
2. **Investigation:**
   - Review container orchestration logs to trace the origin and scope of the activity.
   - Examine host-level processes and file changes associated with the suspicious containers.
   - Analyze network traffic patterns to identify communication endpoints.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any malicious or unauthorized containers from the environment.
   - Apply necessary patches or configuration changes to prevent recurrence.
   - Update security policies and monitoring rules based on findings.
