# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Archive via Utility

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing compression utilities for data exfiltration purposes. By recognizing when sensitive files are being compressed (and potentially encrypted), organizations can prevent unauthorized data removal.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages monitoring of file activity and system logs to identify patterns indicative of compression for exfiltration. Key data sources include:

- File integrity monitoring (FIM)
- Security information and event management (SIEM) systems
- Syslog and application logs

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual compression command usage in scripts or terminal sessions.
- High-volume file compressions, especially involving sensitive directories.
- Changes in system configurations that enable/disable remote logging.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use utilities like `rar`, `zip`, `7z`, `gzip`, and others to compress data before exfiltration. This technique often involves:
- Compressing files into a single archive, sometimes encrypting them.
- Altering system configurations to obscure their activities (e.g., disabling Syslog on ESXi).
  
Adversaries execute these actions via command-line interfaces or automated scripts, making it challenging for traditional monitoring tools to detect unless they're tailored to recognize such anomalies.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Monitoring might miss encrypted archives if decryption is not feasible in real-time.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that baseline activities are well-understood, allowing deviations due to compression utilities to be easily identified.

## False Positives
Potential benign triggers include:
- Legitimate business operations requiring routine data backup using compression tools.
- Software development environments where source code is routinely compressed for deployment or distribution.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The potential for sensitive data exfiltration poses a significant risk to organizational security and compliance. Early detection can prevent substantial data loss and mitigate associated damages.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Compress Data for Exfiltration With Rar**
   - Command: `rar a archive.rar /path/to/data`

2. **Compress Data and Lock with Password for Exfiltration with WinRAR**
   - Command: `WinRAR a -p"password" encrypted_archive.rar /path/to/data`

3. **Compress Data and Lock with Password for Exfiltration with WinZip**
   - Command: `zip -e secure.zip /path/to/data`

4. **Compress Data and Lock with Password for Exfiltration with 7zip**
   - Command: `7z a -p"password" secured_archive.7z /path/to/data`

5. **Data Compressed - nix - zip**
   - Command: `zip archive.zip /path/to/data`

6. **Data Compressed - nix - gzip Single File**
   - Command: `gzip singlefile.txt`

7. **Data Compressed - nix - tar Folder or File**
   - Command: `tar czf archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory`

8. **Data Encrypted with zip and gpg Symmetric**
   - Commands:
     ```bash
     zip -e archive.zip /path/to/data
     gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 secured_data.zip.gpg
     ```

9. **Encrypts Collected Data with AES-256 and Base64**
   - Command:
     ```bash
     openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in data.txt -out encrypted.dat -pass pass:yourpassword && base64 < encrypted.dat > encrypted_base64.dat
     ```

10. **ESXi - Remove Syslog Remote IP**
    - Procedure involves accessing the ESXi host and modifying syslog configurations to remove remote logging.

11. **Compress a File for Exfiltration using Makecab**
    - Command: `makecab /path/to/data.cab path\to\data`

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected systems.
- Review logs for unauthorized access or unusual behavior.
- Verify whether the compression activity aligns with known business processes.
- Engage incident response protocols to assess and mitigate any potential data exfiltration.

## Additional Resources
For further context and techniques, consider reviewing:
- Procedures on using WINZIP for password-protected archives.
- Methods of enumerating files via command-line utilities.
- Usage scenarios for RAR commands involving passwords and compression settings. 

This comprehensive approach enables a proactive stance against adversaries employing archive utilities in their attack vectors.
