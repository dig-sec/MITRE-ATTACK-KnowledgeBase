# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technology. Attackers often exploit containers to obscure malicious activities and evade traditional detection mechanisms.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container orchestration environments, such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. Key data sources include container logs, network traffic, and configuration files. Patterns analyzed include unusual network connections from containers, unexpected changes in container configurations, and anomalies in image source integrity.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to launch reconnaissance activities by hiding their IP addresses or running tools like Nmap within a containerized environment. This technique allows them to conduct scans while minimizing the risk of detection by traditional security systems that are not tuned for container traffic.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --rm nmap <target-ip>`
  - `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- nmap <target-ip>`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a benign container and monitor for unexpected network connections.
  - Alter container configurations to simulate adversary behavior.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all containers are monitored, which may not be the case in large environments.
- Relies on accurate baseline data; deviations might indicate legitimate changes rather than adversarial activity.
- Assumes comprehensive logging is enabled for all relevant components.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate network scans performed by IT teams for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes.
- Dynamic IP address allocations within containerized environments leading to frequent changes.
- Automated deployment scripts that modify container configurations regularly.

## Priority
**High:** This technique can significantly undermine security monitoring capabilities, allowing adversaries to conduct reconnaissance undetected. The potential impact of bypassing detection mechanisms justifies a high priority for addressing this threat.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected containers or nodes to prevent further unauthorized activities.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Review container logs and network traffic to identify the source and scope of the activity.
   - Verify any changes in configurations against known baselines.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Apply necessary patches or configuration updates to close security gaps.
   - Enhance monitoring rules to reduce false positives without compromising detection capabilities.
