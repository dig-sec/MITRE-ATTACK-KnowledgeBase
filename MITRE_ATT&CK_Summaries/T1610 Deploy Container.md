# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technology. Specifically, it focuses on identifying unauthorized deployment and usage of containers that could be used for malicious activities such as evasion, command execution, or resource exploitation.

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Execution
- **Platforms:** Containers

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring for anomalous container activities that may indicate adversarial attempts to bypass security measures. Data sources such as container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker), network traffic analysis, and host system activity are used. Patterns analyzed include unexpected deployment of containers, unusual resource utilization spikes, or communication with known malicious IP addresses.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to deploy malware or execute commands discreetly on compromised systems. Containers can be rapidly deployed and modified, making them attractive for evasion techniques. In the real world, adversaries might exploit container vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access or maintain persistence.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Deploying a malicious Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -d --name evil_container nginx
    ```
  - Executing commands within a running container:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it evil_container /bin/sh
    ```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Unauthorized Deployment:** Deploy a container without proper authorization or logging.
2. **Resource Exploitation:** Monitor for containers consuming excessive resources unexpectedly.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss sophisticated evasion techniques that mimic legitimate container activity.
  - Insufficient coverage of custom or proprietary orchestration systems.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes baseline knowledge of normal container usage patterns within the environment.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate high-volume deployments during peak times or maintenance windows.
- DevOps practices involving frequent container spin-ups and tear-downs.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:** Containers are increasingly used in modern IT environments, making them a prime target for adversaries. The ability to bypass security monitoring can lead to significant breaches, data exfiltration, or system compromise.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on the test machine.
   - Configure logging for container activities.

2. **Deploy a Malicious Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -d --name evil_container nginx
   ```

3. **Execute Commands Within the Container:**
   ```bash
   docker exec -it evil_container /bin/sh
   ```

4. **Monitor for Alerts:**
   - Check logs and alerts triggered by the deployment and execution activities.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately investigate the container's origin and purpose.
- Review associated network traffic for suspicious activity.
- Assess whether the container was deployed with proper authorization.
- If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate the affected systems and containers, and begin remediation procedures.
