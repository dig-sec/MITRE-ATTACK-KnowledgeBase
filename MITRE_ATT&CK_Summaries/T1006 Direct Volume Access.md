# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that aim to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by leveraging container technologies.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1006 - Direct Volume Access
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1006)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy is centered around monitoring and analyzing data sources such as container logs, volume access patterns, and system event logs. The focus is on identifying abnormal or suspicious behaviors that indicate adversaries are accessing volumes directly to evade security controls.

### Data Sources:
- **Container Logs:** Monitor the logs for unusual activities like unexpected creation or deletion of containers.
- **Volume Access Patterns:** Detect irregular accesses to disk volumes which may suggest direct volume access attempts.
- **System Event Logs:** Review Windows event logs for events that correlate with known evasion techniques.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Unusual spikes in read/write operations on disk volumes.
- Attempts to manipulate container configurations or volumes beyond normal operational parameters.
- Access patterns indicative of unauthorized boot sector reads or modifications.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit containers to maintain persistence and evade detection by traditional security tools. Techniques such as direct volume access are used to modify or extract data from disk volumes without triggering alerts.

### Execution Details:
1. **Volume Boot Sector Reads:** Adversaries may attempt to read the boot sector of a volume using PowerShell commands like `Get-Content -Path '\\.\C:'`.
2. **Manipulation of Container Filesystems:** Direct manipulation of container filesystems can be used to hide malicious activities.
3. **Evasion Tactics:** Techniques include altering or hiding file system artifacts and exploiting known blind spots in monitoring tools.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- Use PowerShell to read volume boot sector: `Get-Content -Path '\\.\C:'`
- Create a container with unusual configurations that bypass standard security checks.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** All containers are running on Windows platforms.
- **Blind Spot:** Detection may miss sophisticated evasion techniques not covered by existing logs or patterns.
- **Limitation:** High false positive rates if legitimate administrative activities mimic adversarial behaviors.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger alerts include:
- Legitimate system maintenance tasks involving volume management.
- Authorized software installations or updates requiring direct disk access.
- Misconfigured containers leading to unintended read/write operations.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
- Direct volume access can lead to significant data breaches and persistent threats if not detected promptly.
- Adversaries leveraging this technique are likely highly skilled, indicating a severe threat level.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate detection capabilities, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Setup:**
   - Create a Windows-based container environment using Docker or similar tools.
   - Ensure logging is enabled for containers and system events.

2. **Emulate Technique:**
   - Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.
   - Execute the command to read volume boot sector:
     ```powershell
     Get-Content -Path '\\.\C:'
     ```
   - Monitor logs for any alerts or anomalies triggered by this action.

3. **Analyze Results:**
   - Review container and system event logs for detections.
   - Verify if the alerting mechanisms correctly identify the unauthorized access attempt.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate the affected containers to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and impact of the activity.
- Implement additional security controls or update existing ones to mitigate future risks.
- Document findings and adjust detection rules to reduce false positives.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no specific resources are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework for this technique. Analysts should stay informed about emerging threats and best practices in container security.
