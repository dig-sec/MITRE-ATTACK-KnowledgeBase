# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1189 - Drive-by Compromise
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Initial Access
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS, SaaS

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying and analyzing suspicious container activities that may indicate an attempt to bypass security measures. This involves monitoring log data from orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) and endpoint telemetry. Key patterns include unusual or unauthorized creation of containers, unexpected network traffic originating from these containers, and any attempts to modify the host environment through container escape techniques.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers for their stealth capabilities in a compromised environment. They exploit vulnerabilities within container runtimes or orchestration platforms to gain persistent access while evading detection by traditional monitoring systems. Common methods include:
- **Container Escapes:** Exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to escape from the containerized environment.
- **Persistent Access:** Using containers as pivot points for lateral movement and maintaining access.

Adversary emulation might involve using tools like `kubectl` or Docker CLI commands to create unauthorized containers, simulate escape attempts via known exploits, and attempt network reconnaissance within a test lab setup.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection may not cover zero-day container vulnerabilities.
- Assumes that all relevant data sources (e.g., orchestration logs) are properly configured and ingested in real-time.
- Might miss detection if adversaries use novel or highly sophisticated techniques for obfuscation.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks involving container management.
- Automated deployment processes creating temporary containers.
- Routine network scans from within containers used in CI/CD pipelines.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Container-based attacks can significantly impact the integrity and availability of services, especially if they facilitate lateral movement or data exfiltration. The stealthiness of container deployments can lead to prolonged undetected compromise.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:
1. Set up a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes.
2. Create a benign container and use `kubectl` or Docker CLI commands to simulate an unauthorized container creation.
3. Attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities for container escapes (e.g., using tools like `kube-hunter`).
4. Monitor system logs and network traffic for any alerts triggered by these actions.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating suspicious container activity:
1. Immediately isolate the affected containers or nodes from the network.
2. Conduct a forensic analysis of the container's filesystem, configuration files, and network connections.
3. Review access logs to identify potential points of compromise and unauthorized changes in configurations.
4. Update security controls and patch vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
