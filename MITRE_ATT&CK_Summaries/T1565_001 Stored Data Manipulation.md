  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/001)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on identifying adversarial activities that involve the manipulation of stored data within containers to evade security monitoring. It leverages log analysis from container orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker) and network traffic inspection to identify anomalies indicative of such manipulation.

### Data Sources
- Container logs: To monitor configuration changes or anomalous container behavior.
- Network Traffic: For unusual patterns indicating communication between compromised containers.
- Host system metrics: For detecting resource usage spikes that could suggest evasion tactics in play.

### Patterns Analyzed
- Unusual volume or frequency of data modifications within a container's file system.
- Unauthorized access attempts to sensitive files within the container environment.
- Unexpected network connections from a container to external IP addresses.

## Technical Context

Adversaries manipulate stored data within containers by modifying configuration files, altering logs, or introducing malicious payloads that evade detection. This technique often involves:

- Exploiting misconfigurations in container orchestration platforms.
- Bypassing host-based security tools via compromised container runtime environments.
- Using side-channel attacks to infer system activity without triggering alerts.

### Real-World Execution
Adversaries may execute this by:
- Leveraging scripts or binaries placed within container image builds to modify data at runtime.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in orchestration software to escalate privileges and manipulate configurations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Highly sophisticated adversaries that use zero-day exploits may bypass detection mechanisms altogether.
  - Containers running legitimate, high-volume data manipulation tasks (e.g., big data processing) could be mistakenly flagged as malicious.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The underlying host security infrastructure is robust and correctly configured to prevent initial container breaches.
  - Container orchestration platforms are regularly updated and patched against known vulnerabilities.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate software updates or configurations within containers.
- Normal traffic patterns from containers involved in routine data processing tasks.
- High-volume log generation during maintenance windows or debugging sessions.

## Priority
**High**

Justification: The technique allows adversaries to maintain persistence and operate undetected within an environment, significantly increasing the risk of long-term compromise. Early detection is crucial to prevent potential data exfiltration or further lateral movement across the network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no specific adversary emulation steps are available for this technique in a test environment. Developing such scenarios would involve:

1. Setting up containers with known vulnerabilities.
2. Simulating data manipulation activities by an attacker-controlled container.
3. Monitoring and validating detection responses using the outlined ADS framework.

## Response

Upon alert activation:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate affected containers from the network to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement.
  - Conduct a thorough review of recent changes in configuration files and logs for signs of tampering.
  
- **Investigation Steps:**
  - Correlate alerts with other security events to understand the scope and impact.
  - Examine container images and build processes for any unauthorized modifications.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Update security policies and configurations to prevent similar attacks.
  - Train staff on recognizing signs of data manipulation within containers.
