# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Binary Padding

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that involve altering executable files by adding padding in order to bypass security monitoring systems, change hash values, and evade detection. This can allow adversaries to conceal their activities or disguise malicious binaries as legitimate software.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying changes to executable binaries that could indicate the use of padding techniques. The primary data sources include file integrity monitoring systems, antivirus logs, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Patterns analyzed involve sudden increases in file sizes for executables without corresponding legitimate updates or patches.

Key indicators of compromise (IoCs) may include:
- Unusual changes in hash values for known binaries.
- Unexpected modifications to executable files detected by integrity monitoring tools.
- Log entries showing binary manipulations using commands like `dd` or `truncate`.

## Technical Context
Binary padding is a technique where adversaries add additional data to an executable file. This can be done to alter the hash value of the binary, allowing it to bypass signature-based detection mechanisms that rely on known hashes.

### Real-World Execution
Adversaries may execute binary padding by:
1. Using tools like `dd` or `truncate` to append or modify bytes within a binary.
2. Automating this process with scripts to alter multiple files systematically.

Example commands for emulating binary padding include:
- **Linux/macOS dd:** `dd if=/dev/zero of=malicious_binary padded bs=1M count=10 conv=notrunc`
- **Linux/macOS truncate:** `truncate -s +10485760 malicious_binary`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- The strategy assumes that changes in file size or hash are indicative of malicious activity, which may not always be true.
- Legitimate software updates or legitimate user modifications to files could generate similar alerts.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- System administrators performing authorized binary updates or maintenance.
- Software development processes involving frequent builds and packaging that alter binaries.
- Use of tools for benign purposes such as file padding for testing or recovery operations.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the technique is a common evasion method, its execution may be detected by comprehensive monitoring solutions. However, it can still pose significant risks if left unchecked, especially in environments with sensitive data or critical infrastructure.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions to Emulate Binary Padding

#### Pad Binary to Change Hash - Linux/macOS dd
1. Open a terminal.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/zero of=malicious_binary padded bs=1M count=10 conv=notrunc
   ```
3. Verify changes in file size and hash value.

#### Pad Binary to Change Hash using truncate command - Linux/macOS
1. Open a terminal.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   truncate -s +10485760 malicious_binary
   ```
3. Confirm that the file size has increased and the hash value differs from its original state.

## Response
When an alert for binary padding is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify Legitimacy:** Determine if there are valid reasons for the change (e.g., recent software updates).
2. **Analyze Context:** Review logs and events surrounding the modification to assess whether it aligns with known threats or patterns.
3. **Containment Measures:** If deemed malicious, isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.
4. **Investigate Source:** Identify how adversaries gained access and take steps to remediate vulnerabilities.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available for this specific technique. Analysts should refer to broader security frameworks and industry best practices for managing binary integrity and detecting evasion techniques.
