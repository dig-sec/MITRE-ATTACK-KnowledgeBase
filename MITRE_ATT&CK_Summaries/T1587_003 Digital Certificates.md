# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to misuse digital certificates for malicious purposes such as gaining unauthorized access, exfiltrating data, or executing man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1587.003 - Digital Certificates
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Environment)
  
[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/003)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on identifying suspicious activities related to digital certificates, such as unauthorized certificate issuance or the use of rogue certificates. This involves analyzing data from several sources:

- **Certificate Transparency Logs:** Monitor for unexpected or anomalous certificate requests.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identify unusual patterns in SSL/TLS traffic that could indicate misuse of certificates.
- **System and Application Logs:** Look for signs of unauthorized certificate installations or changes.

Patterns analyzed include anomalies in certificate attributes, irregularities in issuance processes, and deviations from typical network behavior associated with secure connections.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often exploit digital certificates to establish trust where it shouldn't exist. Common tactics include:

- **Self-Signed Certificates:** Creating their own trusted environment by issuing self-signed certificates.
- **Compromised Certificate Authorities (CAs):** Exploiting weaknesses in CA processes to issue fraudulent certificates.
- **Misuse of Legitimate Certificates:** Stealing or replicating legitimate certificates for malicious purposes.

### Real-World Execution

Adversaries might use commands such as:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

This command generates a self-signed certificate, which can be used to create a rogue HTTPS server.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spot:** Detection might miss certificates issued by compromised or maliciously operated CAs that appear legitimate.
- **Assumption:** The baseline of normal behavior is accurately established, allowing for the detection of deviations.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities include:

- Legitimate use of self-signed certificates in development environments.
- Routine certificate renewal processes that might not follow typical patterns.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: The misuse of digital certificates can lead to significant breaches, including data exfiltration and unauthorized access. The ability for adversaries to establish trust undetected makes it a critical threat vector.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

None available

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Assessment:** Determine the scope of affected systems and potential impact.
2. **Certificate Analysis:** Review certificate details, issuance process, and associated applications.
3. **Network Segmentation:** Isolate suspicious networks to prevent further spread.
4. **Incident Reporting:** Document findings and notify relevant stakeholders.
5. **Remediation:** Revoke unauthorized certificates and strengthen CA processes.
