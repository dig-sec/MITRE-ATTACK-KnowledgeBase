# Detection Strategy Report: Data Encrypted for Impact (T1486)

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to encrypt files and directories for impact within an organization's environment. This encompasses efforts by threat actors to execute ransomware attacks, which can significantly disrupt operations by making critical data inaccessible.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Impact
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, IaaS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring file system activities and command execution patterns across various platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) to identify unauthorized encryption processes. Key data sources include:

- **File System Monitoring:** Track changes in files or directories with unusual access patterns.
- **Command Execution Logs:** Monitor for execution of known encryption commands (`gpg`, `openssl`, `7z`, `ccrypt`).
- **Process Activity Analysis:** Identify suspicious processes that might be encrypting files.

Patterns analyzed include the creation of new encrypted file extensions, rapid mass file modifications, and unusual command usage in directories containing sensitive data.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use encryption to hold data hostage as part of a ransomware attack. Common tools used for this purpose include `gpg`, `openssl`, `7z`, and custom scripts or binaries designed specifically for ransomware operations (e.g., Akira Ransomware). These adversaries typically execute the following actions in real-world scenarios:

- Deploy malware that automatically encrypts files.
- Use remote access to execute encryption commands on affected systems.
- Drop ransom notes indicating that data has been encrypted.

Adversary emulation involves replicating these behaviors using tools like `gpg`, `7z`, and `openssl` to test the detection strategy's effectiveness in identifying such threats.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:

- **Encrypted Volume Management Tools:** Legitimate use of encryption tools by users for backups or secure data handling can be misinterpreted.
- **Custom Encryption Methods:** New or unknown ransomware variants using unique encryption methods may not trigger existing detection patterns.
- **Network Latency and Bandwidth Constraints:** May affect real-time monitoring capabilities.

Assumptions:

- Systems are configured to log necessary file system changes and command executions.
- Users have a baseline understanding of normal vs. suspicious activities within their environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of encryption tools by IT staff for routine data protection tasks.
- Automated backup processes involving file compression or encryption.
- Software updates deploying encrypted binaries temporarily during installation.

To mitigate these, context-aware detection mechanisms and whitelisting known legitimate activities are recommended.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Data encryption attacks can lead to significant operational disruptions and financial losses. The potential impact of ransomware demands swift and effective detection strategies to minimize damage and restore operations quickly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Encrypt files using `gpg` on FreeBSD/Linux:**
   ```bash
   gpg -c sensitive_file.txt
   ```

2. **Encrypt files using `7z` on FreeBSD/Linux:**
   ```bash
   7z a -tzip -p'password' archive.zip sensitive_file.txt
   ```

3. **Encrypt files using `ccrypt` on FreeBSD/Linux:**
   ```bash
   ccrypt sensitive_file.txt
   ```

4. **Encrypt files using `openssl` on FreeBSD/Linux:**
   ```bash
   openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in sensitive_file.txt -out encrypted_file.txt.enc
   ```

5. **Drop PureLocker Ransom Note:** Create a text file named `README_FOR_DECRYPT_FILES.txt` in the affected directory.

6. **Encrypt files using `7z` utility on macOS:**
   ```bash
   7z a -tzip -p'password' archive.zip sensitive_file.txt
   ```

7. **Encrypt files using `openssl` utility on macOS:**
   ```bash
   openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in sensitive_file.txt -out encrypted_file.txt.enc
   ```

8. **Data Encrypted with GPG4Win:** On Windows, use:
   ```cmd
   gpg --symmetric sensitive_file.txt
   ```

9. **Data Encrypt Using DiskCryptor:** Use DiskCryptor software to encrypt disk volumes.

10. **Akira Ransomware Simulation:**
    - Rename files with a `.akira` extension.
    - Drop ransom notes in the affected directories.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:

- Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread of malware.
- Assess the scope and impact by reviewing logs for related command executions and file changes.
- Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT security teams and management.
- Initiate incident response procedures, which may include data restoration from backups and system recovery processes.
- Investigate the entry point of the attack to identify vulnerabilities and prevent future incidents.
