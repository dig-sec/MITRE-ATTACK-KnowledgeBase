# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers, specifically focusing on the use of CMSTP (Computer Management System Tool - Trusted Path) for executing remote scriptlets and UAC (User Account Control) bypasses.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages various data sources, including process monitoring, network traffic analysis, and event logs, to identify patterns indicative of CMSTP abuse. Key indicators include unusual scriptlet execution from trusted paths, unexpected remote command executions, and signs of UAC bypass attempts.

### Data Sources:
- **Process Monitoring:** Observes processes initiated via CMSTP.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Detects anomalous communication patterns associated with scriptlet execution.
- **Event Logs:** Analyzes Windows Event Logs for suspicious activities linked to CMSTP usage.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit CMSTP to execute scripts and commands with elevated privileges, bypassing security mechanisms like UAC. This technique is often used in lateral movement within networks to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

### Real-World Execution:
- **Remote Scriptlet Execution:** Adversaries use CMSTP to run PowerShell or other scriptlets remotely on a victim machine.
- **UAC Bypass:** By leveraging trusted paths, adversaries execute commands without triggering UAC prompts.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Known Limitations:**
  - Detection may not cover all variations of CMSTP misuse.
  - Encrypted network traffic can obscure malicious activity.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Security monitoring tools are properly configured to capture relevant data.
  - Baseline behavior is well-understood for accurate anomaly detection.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative use of CMSTP for remote management.
- Scheduled tasks or scripts executed via trusted paths as part of routine operations.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security controls and execute commands with elevated privileges poses a significant risk, potentially leading to data exfiltration, system compromise, and lateral movement within the network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet
1. **Setup:** Create a test environment with Windows machines.
2. **Execution:**
   - Use `cscript.exe` or similar tools to execute a scriptlet remotely via CMSTP.
   - Example command: `C:\Windows\System32\cscript.exe //Nologo cscript.vbs /B`
3. **Observation:** Monitor for unexpected process execution and network activity.

### CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass
1. **Setup:** Ensure the environment allows testing of privilege escalation techniques.
2. **Execution:**
   - Use CMSTP to execute a command with elevated privileges without triggering UAC.
   - Example scenario: Launching PowerShell with administrative rights using `psexec` and CMSTP.
3. **Observation:** Check for signs of UAC bypass, such as unauthorized privilege escalation.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze logs and process activities related to CMSTP usage.
   - Determine the scope of the compromise and identify affected systems.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Revoke unauthorized access and privileges.
   - Update security configurations to prevent similar attacks.
4. **Communication:** Inform stakeholders about the incident and potential impacts.
