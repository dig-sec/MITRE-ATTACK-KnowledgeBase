# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containers within cloud infrastructures, specifically focusing on the tactic of using internal container images for persistence.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1525 - Implant Internal Image
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence
- **Platforms:** IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), Containers
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1525)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on identifying suspicious activities involving container images that adversaries use to maintain persistence and evade security measures. This involves monitoring data sources such as container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), image registries, and network traffic related to container operations.

Key patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual or unauthorized creation of internal container images.
- Inconsistent metadata within container images that suggest tampering.
- Anomalies in the pull and run commands for container images from private or unexpected repositories.
- Suspicious network connections initiated by containers post-deployment.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often exploit containerization technologies to deploy persistent, stealthy payloads within cloud environments. They might build internal images with malicious code embedded and push these images into an enterprise's image registry. Once deployed, these compromised containers can operate under the guise of legitimate processes, making detection challenging.

Example adversary actions include:
- Creating a container image with a backdoor.
- Pushing this image to an internal registry.
- Deploying it within a Kubernetes cluster without triggering traditional endpoint security alerts.

Adversary Emulation Details:
- Use tools like `docker` or `podman` to build and push images containing malicious payloads.
- Commands for building and pushing might include: 
  ```bash
  docker build -t malicious_image .
  docker tag malicious_image registry.internal.com/malicious_image
  docker push registry.internal.com/malicious_image
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spot:** The detection strategy may not fully account for adversaries using obfuscation techniques to mask image content.
- **Assumption:** All internal registries are monitored, which may not be the case in decentralized or poorly governed environments.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Developers frequently pushing and pulling new container images as part of CI/CD pipelines.
- Legitimate but unusual use of non-standard image repositories by certain development teams.
- Temporary network spikes during deployment operations.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: The technique targets persistence, a critical phase in the adversary's lifecycle. Successful exploitation can lead to long-term unauthorized access and data exfiltration, posing significant risks to organizational security.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

None available. However, organizations should consider setting up isolated environments where:
- Internal images are crafted and pushed as part of an emulation exercise.
- Anomalies in container deployment processes are monitored for detection validation.

## Response

When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. Verify the legitimacy of the container image source.
2. Review recent changes to image registries or orchestration configurations.
3. Analyze network traffic from the affected containers for signs of data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication.
4. Contain and isolate any suspicious containers to prevent further potential compromise.
5. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the extent of the breach.

## Additional Resources

Additional references and context are currently not available but should include:
- Organizational policies on container image management.
- Best practices for securing container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
- Continuous updates from MITRE ATT&CK regarding similar techniques or variations. 

This ADS report provides a comprehensive framework for detecting adversarial use of internal container images to achieve persistence, aiding in the proactive defense against sophisticated threats within cloud environments.
