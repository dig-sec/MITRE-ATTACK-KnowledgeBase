# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This detection technique aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using Domain Name System (DNS) calculations to determine IP addresses of command and control servers dynamically.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1568.003 - DNS Calculation
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/003)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring network traffic for suspicious DNS requests that could indicate the use of DNS calculation techniques. Key data sources include:
- Network Traffic Logs
- DNS Request Logs

Patterns analyzed involve unusual or frequent DNS requests for non-existent domains, which may be indicative of attempts to resolve dynamically generated IP addresses associated with command and control servers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often employ DNS calculations by embedding domain names in their payloads that are resolved at runtime. This technique allows them to remain stealthy as the destination IP changes frequently, evading static blacklists.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Command:** Malware may use a function like `Resolve-DnsName` in PowerShell or embedded commands in executable files on Linux/macOS.
- **Test Scenario:** Craft DNS requests using encoded domain names within a script and execute the script to simulate adversary behavior.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes all DNS requests can be monitored; encrypted DNS traffic might not be visible.
- May miss sophisticated encoding techniques that evade basic pattern recognition.
- Relies on accurate baseline data for normal network activity, which may vary significantly across organizations.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Dynamic DNS usage by legitimate applications (e.g., some cloud services).
- Legitimate software updates using encoded domain names for version checks.
- Developers or IT personnel testing DNS configurations.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: 
The ability to dynamically calculate IP addresses enables persistent and stealthy command and control communications, making it a significant threat vector that can undermine traditional security controls.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-step Instructions:
1. **Setup Test Environment:** Ensure a controlled network segment with monitoring tools enabled.
2. **Simulate Malware Behavior:**
   - Develop a script to generate DNS requests for non-existent domains.
   - Execute the script on test machines running different OS platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
3. **Capture Data:**
   - Monitor and capture DNS request logs and network traffic using tools like Wireshark or Splunk.
4. **Analyze Patterns:** 
   - Identify frequent requests to non-existent domains.
5. **Evaluate Detection Performance:** 
   - Assess if the monitoring system triggers alerts appropriately.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Verify Alert Validity:**
   - Check logs for corroborating evidence of malicious activity, such as simultaneous suspicious network connections or data exfiltration attempts.
2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent potential lateral movement by adversaries.
3. **Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough investigation using endpoint detection and response tools to identify any additional signs of compromise.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove malicious binaries or scripts, reset compromised credentials, and patch vulnerabilities as needed.
