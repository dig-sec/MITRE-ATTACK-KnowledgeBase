# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containers. Specifically, it focuses on identifying when attackers deploy malicious activities within containerized environments to evade traditional detection mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Execution)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing container-related activities to identify patterns indicative of adversarial actions. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- Network traffic related to container communication
- Host-level system logs for anomalous processes or configurations

Patterns analyzed involve unusual container deployments, unexpected inter-container communications, or unauthorized access attempts within the container environment.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit containers by deploying malicious payloads that appear benign but perform reconnaissance activities. They might use containers to execute scripts, exfiltrate data, or establish persistent access without being detected by traditional monitoring tools. Real-world execution often involves:

- Deploying a compromised image from a public repository
- Using container escape techniques to gain host-level access

Adversary emulation can involve deploying benign test images with unusual metadata or network behavior to simulate these activities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into encrypted container traffic may obscure detection efforts.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that adversaries are using containers in ways distinct from standard operational practices within the organization.

## False Positives

Potential false positives include:

- Legitimate use of new or uncommon container images for development or testing purposes
- Routine administrative tasks involving container management that mimic adversarial behavior

## Priority

**High**: The ability to bypass security monitoring through containers poses a significant risk, as it allows adversaries to conduct activities undetected. The stealthy nature and potential impact on organizational security necessitate high-priority detection.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are not currently available. However, organizations can simulate adversary behavior by:

1. Deploying containers with modified configurations or metadata that deviate from normal patterns.
2. Monitoring the response of existing security controls and adjusting detection rules accordingly.

## Response

When an alert fires indicating potential adversarial use of containers, analysts should:

- Immediately isolate affected containers to prevent further activity.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of container logs and network traffic for signs of malicious behavior.
- Review recent changes in container deployments or configurations that could have introduced vulnerabilities.
- Coordinate with development teams to ensure future images are vetted against security policies.

## Additional Resources

No additional resources currently available. Organizations should refer to their internal documentation on container security best practices and threat intelligence feeds for further context.
