# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass macOS security mechanisms using containerization methods.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1553.001 - Gatekeeper Bypass
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages system logs and process monitoring to identify attempts to circumvent Gatekeeper—a built-in security feature of macOS that restricts the execution of unauthorized applications. Key data sources include:
- System log files (e.g., `/var/log/system.log`)
- Process activity logs
- Network traffic analysis

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual processes spawned from container environments.
- Attempts to execute binaries with modified signatures or missing signatures.
- Network requests to known malicious IP addresses or domains associated with container-based malware.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers as a means to run malicious payloads while evading traditional security controls that are not optimized for containerized environments. In the context of macOS, this often involves:
- Using tools like Docker or other containerization software.
- Modifying binary files to bypass Gatekeeper’s checks.
- Exploiting misconfigurations in user permissions and system settings.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Common methods include:
- Installing and configuring a container runtime such as Docker.
- Crafting malicious binaries that leverage specific vulnerabilities within the macOS environment or exploit misconfigured Gatekeeper settings.
- Executing test scenarios where these binaries are loaded into containers and attempts are made to run them on host systems.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
### Known Limitations:
- Detection may not cover all new methods as they evolve, particularly those exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities.
- Highly sophisticated adversaries might employ techniques that mimic legitimate container usage patterns, making detection challenging.
  
### Assumptions:
- The system’s logging is sufficiently detailed to capture necessary data for analysis.
- Analysts are familiar with both typical and atypical behavior of containers on macOS.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of container technology by developers or IT staff for software testing purposes.
- Running signed but non-Mac App Store approved applications, which may still be legitimate in certain organizational contexts.
- Use of developer tools that modify binaries for debugging and analysis.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

### Justification:
- Containers are becoming increasingly common in enterprise environments, providing adversaries with new avenues to exploit.
- Gatekeeper bypass can enable the execution of malicious software without detection, leading to potential data breaches or system compromises.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Set Up Docker on macOS:**
   - Install Docker Desktop for Mac from [Docker’s official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Create a Malicious Container Image:**
   - Prepare an image with a binary that attempts to bypass Gatekeeper by modifying its signature.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     docker build -t test/malicious .
     ```

3. **Run the Container and Attempt Execution:**
   - Start the container:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm -it test/malicious /bin/bash
     ```
   - Within the container, try to execute a binary that would typically be blocked by Gatekeeper.

4. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Check system logs for any unusual activities or error messages indicating attempts to bypass security controls.
   - Use tools like `dtruss` to monitor system calls and detect anomalies during execution.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Prevent further spread by disconnecting from the network if necessary.
2. **Analyze Logs:** Investigate logs for detailed information on the container activity and binary execution attempts.
3. **Inspect Containers:** Check running containers for any unauthorized modifications or suspicious configurations.
4. **Verify Integrity:** Use tools to verify the integrity of binaries against known good versions.
5. **Update Security Measures:** Review and enhance security policies related to container usage, ensuring Gatekeeper settings are appropriately configured.
