# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using containers. Specifically, it focuses on identifying when adversaries leverage container environments to conceal their activities and evade detection mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1588 - Obtain Capabilities
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Platform Remotely Exploited)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring container activities to identify suspicious patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- Network traffic associated with containerized applications
- System and application logs for abnormal activity or configuration changes

Patterns analyzed will focus on unusual resource consumption, unexpected network communications, and anomalous process behaviors within containers.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit container environments to deploy malicious payloads while bypassing traditional security controls. They often utilize techniques such as:

- Running unauthorized processes inside containers
- Modifying container configurations or images
- Exfiltrating data through container networks

**Emulation Details:**

- Adversaries might use commands like `docker exec` to execute malicious scripts within a running container.
- Test scenarios could involve deploying a benign application in a container, then introducing unexpected network connections or resource spikes.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- Detection may not cover all evasion techniques, especially those using sophisticated obfuscation methods.
- Assumes that logging mechanisms are comprehensive and accurately capture relevant container activity.
- Potential gaps exist if containers communicate over non-standard ports or encrypted channels without proper inspection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of resource-intensive applications within containers
- Authorized network communications for legitimate application functionality
- Configuration changes performed by system administrators as part of routine maintenance

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly popular in modern IT environments, making them attractive targets for adversaries. The ability to bypass security controls undetected poses a significant threat, warranting high priority for detection strategies.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analyze the container logs and network traffic associated with the suspicious activity.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine if the activity is malicious or a false positive by examining process behaviors and configuration changes.
4. **Remediation:** Apply necessary patches or configuration updates to close any vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.
