# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using `InstallUtil`, a utility provided by .NET Framework for installing and uninstalling server resources.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1218.004 - InstallUtil
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows

For more information, refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/004).

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy aims to identify unauthorized use of `InstallUtil` by monitoring and analyzing log data generated during its invocation. The key data sources include Windows Event Logs, Sysmon logs, and PowerShell execution logs.

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Invocation of InstallUtil with unusual parameters or from non-standard directories.
- Execution by accounts with elevated privileges outside typical administrative activities.
- Sudden increases in the usage frequency of `InstallUtil` correlating with other suspicious activity indicators.

## Technical Context
Adversaries leverage `InstallUtil` to execute payloads as trusted processes, often using it to install malicious components without triggering alerts. This technique is commonly seen in scenarios where adversaries aim to evade detection by exploiting legitimate system tools.

**Example Adversary Emulation Commands:**
- Running `installutil.exe /U "path\to\malicious.dll"` to uninstall a component.
- Using `installutil.exe path\to\malicious.dll` for installation operations.
- Evasive invocation with parameters like `/installtype=notransaction`.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
### Known Limitations:
- Difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate software installations by system administrators and malicious activities.
- False negatives may occur if `InstallUtil` is invoked from non-standard paths that are not monitored.

### Assumptions:
- The environment has Sysmon configured to log all relevant processes and file creations.
- Event logs and PowerShell execution logs are properly retained and accessible for analysis.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Routine installations or updates of software by IT personnel using `InstallUtil`.
- Legitimate use in environments where automated scripts deploy applications as part of standard operations.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While `InstallUtil` can be used for evasion, its impact is contingent upon the broader context and intent. It represents a credible threat when combined with other indicators of compromise but requires careful tuning to avoid overwhelming false positives from benign administrative activities.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a controlled test environment:

1. **CheckIfInstallable Method Call:**
   - Simulate `installutil.exe /i "path\to\test.dll"` and observe log entries for method calls.

2. **InstallHelper Method Call:**
   - Monitor using Sysmon to capture the call stack during installation attempts.

3. **InstallUtil Class Constructor Method Call:**
   - Utilize a debug environment to trace constructor invocations in `installutil.exe`.

4. **InstallUtil Install Method Call:**
   - Execute with elevated privileges and log the process for analysis.

5. **InstallUtil Uninstall Method Call - /U Variant:**
   - Run `installutil.exe /U "path\to\test.dll"` to trigger uninstallation logs.

6. **InstallUtil Uninstall Method Call - '/installtype=notransaction /action=uninstall' Variant:**
   - Execute using specified parameters and verify log entries for evasive patterns.

7. **InstallUtil HelpText Method Call:**
   - Invoke `installutil.exe /?` to ensure help requests are captured in logs.

8. **InstallUtil Evasive Invocation:**
   - Test with non-standard command-line arguments designed to mimic evasion tactics and confirm detection.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of `InstallUtil` invocation context, including user account activities and associated processes.
- Review recent changes or updates that may correlate with the detected activity.
- Update security policies to refine detection rules based on findings.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are not available. Analysts should stay informed about evolving tactics through threat intelligence feeds and community discussions related to `InstallUtil` misuse.
