# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to leverage containerization technologies to bypass security monitoring systems. This involves detecting malicious activities such as deploying malware within containers, exploiting container vulnerabilities, and using containers as a means for lateral movement or exfiltration.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1588.001 - Malware
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Post-Exploitation)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/001)

## Strategy Abstract
This strategy leverages multiple data sources, including container orchestration logs, network traffic analysis, and endpoint detection systems. It analyzes patterns such as unusual container deployment activities, anomalous inter-container communications, unexpected image downloads or updates, and discrepancies in expected resource usage.

Key elements include:
- Monitoring for unexpected changes in container configurations.
- Analyzing abnormal spikes in outbound network traffic from containers.
- Detecting unauthorized access to sensitive data within a containerized environment.
- Identifying discrepancies between declared and actual container activities through behavioral analytics.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containerization by embedding malware into container images or leveraging misconfigurations to gain persistence. They might use containers for command-and-control (C2) operations, as they can provide stealth due to their ephemeral nature and network isolation.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --rm -d <malicious_image>`
  - Exploiting known vulnerabilities using scripts within container images.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a benign container with unexpected outbound traffic to simulate exfiltration attempts.
  - Misconfigure containers to bypass network segmentation, allowing cross-network communications.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Limited visibility into encrypted or obfuscated container communications may hinder detection.
- Assumption that baseline behavior is accurately defined; anomalies are only detectable if baseline drifts are monitored.
- Potential blind spots in detecting zero-day exploits within containers due to lack of known signatures.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate spikes in network traffic during peak application usage or deployments.
- Authorized container updates and configuration changes as part of regular operations.
- Misconfigured security tools leading to benign activities being flagged as malicious.

## Priority
**High.** The ability for adversaries to use containers can significantly increase the stealth, persistence, and impact of their attacks. Containers are widely adopted in modern applications, making this a critical vector that requires robust detection and monitoring strategies.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected containers and networks to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Review container orchestration logs for unauthorized changes or suspicious activities.
   - Analyze network traffic patterns associated with the flagged containers.
   - Inspect endpoint behavior within the containers to identify any malicious payloads or scripts.
3. **Remediation:** Remove compromised container images, apply necessary patches, and update configurations to prevent recurrence.
4. **Notification:** Inform relevant stakeholders, including IT security teams, about the incident for further action.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no specific external resources are available beyond general documentation on container security best practices and MITRE ATT&CK framework guidance.

This report provides a comprehensive overview of strategies aimed at detecting adversarial use of containers to bypass security measures. It emphasizes monitoring behaviors rather than relying solely on known signatures, reflecting the dynamic nature of modern cybersecurity threats in containerized environments.
