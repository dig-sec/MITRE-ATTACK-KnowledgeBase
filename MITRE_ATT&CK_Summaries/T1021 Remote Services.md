# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containers. The focus is on identifying when adversaries use containerized environments to evade detection mechanisms and maintain stealth while conducting malicious activities.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1021 - Remote Services
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy utilizes a combination of network and host-based data sources to identify patterns indicative of container misuse for adversarial purposes. Specifically, it analyzes:

- **Network Traffic:** For unusual or unauthorized connections originating from containers that could suggest attempts at lateral movement or remote command execution.
  
- **Container Logs:** To detect anomalies in the behavior of containerized applications, such as unexpected resource usage spikes or access to sensitive files.

- **System Calls and File System Changes:** Monitoring for irregular activity within containers that deviates from normal operational baselines.

The strategy employs machine learning models to establish baseline behaviors and identify deviations indicative of malicious intent. Additionally, it leverages signature-based detection to recognize known adversarial tactics involving container technology.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often utilize containers due to their lightweight nature, ease of deployment, and ability to isolate processes. In practice, they may deploy containers within a compromised host to:

- **Bypass Network Segmentation:** By running unauthorized services that communicate with external threat actors.
  
- **Obfuscate Malicious Payloads:** Using containers as a sandbox environment to execute or analyze malware.

- **Evasion Techniques:** Altering container metadata or runtime configurations to evade detection by traditional security tools.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries might use commands such as `docker run -d --name malicious_container ...` to deploy hidden services within a network. Test scenarios could involve setting up containers with unauthorized listening ports or executing shell commands that interact with sensitive host resources.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** This strategy may not effectively detect stealthy container deployments using advanced obfuscation techniques.
  
- **Assumption:** It assumes baseline normal behavior for containers, which might vary significantly across different environments.

- **Gaps:** Limited detection capabilities in environments where containers are heavily utilized for legitimate purposes, leading to potential noise in alerts.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false positives include:

- Legitimate DevOps processes involving rapid deployment and teardown of containers.
  
- Authorized testing scenarios using containerized applications with atypical configurations or resource usage patterns.

- Network traffic from containers involved in legitimate microservices architectures, which may exhibit dynamic behavior similar to adversarial actions.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The ability for adversaries to use containers to bypass security controls represents a significant threat vector. Given the increasing adoption of container technologies across various sectors, this strategy is crucial for maintaining robust security postures and preventing lateral movement within networks.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential adversarial activity involving containers:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected host to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Incident Analysis:**
   - Review container logs and network traffic associated with the alert.
   - Identify any unauthorized services running within the containers.

3. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough examination of the container environment to determine the extent of compromise.
   - Analyze system calls, file access patterns, and network connections for further insights.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove or remediate affected containers and hosts.
   - Update security policies and monitoring rules to prevent recurrence.

5. **Report & Review:**
   - Document findings and actions taken in response to the alert.
   - Conduct a post-incident review to improve detection capabilities and response strategies.
