# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging container technologies. Specifically, it targets adversaries who exploit containers' inherent isolation and ephemeral nature to obscure malicious activities from traditional security controls.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container activity to uncover malicious patterns indicative of attempts to bypass security controls. It utilizes data from various sources, including:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes events)
- Host system logs for unusual process execution within containers
- Network traffic analysis for anomalous outbound connections from containers

Patterns analyzed include unexpected spikes in resource usage, unauthorized access attempts, and abnormal network behaviors that deviate from established baselines.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit container technologies to execute commands with elevated privileges while avoiding detection. They may use lightweight containers to run malicious scripts or payloads due to the minimal overhead associated with these environments. 

### Adversary Execution in Real World:
- **Container Escape:** Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities within container engines (e.g., Docker) to escape their confined environment and gain access to host resources.
- **Command Injection:** By exploiting misconfigurations, adversaries can inject commands into running containers.

**Sample Commands:**
```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged <malicious-image>
```
This command runs a container with elevated privileges, potentially allowing an adversary to perform operations undetected by host-level security controls.

### Test Scenarios:
- Deploy a test container with misconfigured security settings.
- Attempt to execute commands that simulate malicious activities such as accessing sensitive data or establishing unauthorized network connections.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss attacks conducted through newly discovered vulnerabilities in container technologies.
  - Sophisticated adversaries using multi-stage attack chains might evade detection if they carefully mimic legitimate container usage patterns.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has baseline security controls for monitoring containers, including logging and network policies.
  - Analysts have the capability to correlate data from different sources to identify suspicious activities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of privileged containers for administrative tasks by IT personnel.
- Normal spikes in resource usage due to scheduled maintenance or legitimate application scaling events.
- Authorized network communications initiated by applications running within containers.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security controls using container technologies can lead to significant breaches, potentially granting adversaries access to sensitive data and systems. Containers are increasingly prevalent in modern infrastructures, making this a high-priority concern for organizations relying on them for deploying microservices or applications.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no publicly available step-by-step instructions specific to this technique's emulation in a controlled test environment. Organizations should develop their scenarios based on the technical context and typical adversary behaviors outlined above.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential adversarial activity within containers is triggered:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Confirm whether the container activity deviates from known legitimate patterns.
   - Assess if there are any ongoing security incidents related to the suspicious activity.

2. **Containment Measures:**
   - Isolate the affected container(s) by stopping and removing them.
   - Apply network segmentation or firewall rules to limit potential lateral movement.

3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Analyze logs and system states to determine how the adversary gained access or executed commands.
   - Identify vulnerabilities in container configurations or orchestration setups that were exploited.

4. **Remediation and Hardening:**
   - Patch any discovered vulnerabilities in container engines or related software.
   - Review and strengthen security policies, including least privilege principles for containers.

5. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Update detection strategies to incorporate lessons learned from the incident.
   - Conduct regular audits of container environments to ensure compliance with updated security standards.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional resources available specifically addressing this technique within existing frameworks or research. Organizations should consider leveraging internal knowledge bases and community forums focused on container security for further insights and updates.
