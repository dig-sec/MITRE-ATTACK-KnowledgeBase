# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. The focus is on identifying and mitigating strategies that adversaries use to conceal their activities within containerized environments, thereby evading detection mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1564.007 - VBA Stomping (Analogous technique for evasion in a container context)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/007)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing data from multiple sources to identify suspicious activities within containerized environments. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs (e.g., Docker or Kubernetes)
- System call traces
- Network traffic associated with containers
- File integrity checks on container volumes

Patterns analyzed for detecting evasion attempts include:

- Anomalous changes in file and directory structures
- Unusual process spawning within containers
- Unexpected network connections from containerized applications
- Changes to critical system files or configurations that could indicate tampering

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to bypass security controls by leveraging their ephemeral nature, isolation features, and resource sharing capabilities. Common execution methods include:

- Creating and executing malicious payloads within containers without being detected by traditional endpoint security solutions.
- Modifying container images at runtime or during the build process to include hidden backdoors.
- Using containers for command-and-control (C2) communications through established network tunnels.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In a test scenario, an adversary might:

1. Launch a malicious container from a compromised host.
2. Use file system manipulation techniques to hide processes and files within the container.
3. Establish encrypted communication channels with external C2 servers using tools like `netcat` or custom scripts.

Sample Commands:
- Docker command to run a container: `docker run -d --name malicious_container myimage`
- File hiding in Linux: Using `chattr +i /path/to/hidden_file` within the container

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into container orchestration layers (e.g., Kubernetes) if not properly monitored. Difficulty detecting zero-day vulnerabilities or novel evasion techniques.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that security tools are deployed at both the host and container levels, with appropriate permissions to monitor activities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate development practices involving frequent changes to container images during testing phases.
- Automated processes within CI/CD pipelines that modify file attributes or initiate network connections as part of their workflow.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Container environments are increasingly targeted by adversaries due to their widespread use in modern IT infrastructures. The ability to bypass security monitoring can lead to significant data breaches and operational disruptions.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential evasion activity is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Cross-reference with other indicators of compromise (IOCs) across different logs and systems.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers from the network to prevent further propagation or communication with C2 servers.
3. **Investigation:** Perform a detailed analysis of container images, runtime behavior, and associated metadata to understand the scope of the breach.
4. **Remediation:** Patch vulnerabilities, update security policies, and enhance monitoring capabilities for future detection.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently not available. Analysts should consult up-to-date threat intelligence feeds and community forums dedicated to container security for further insights.
