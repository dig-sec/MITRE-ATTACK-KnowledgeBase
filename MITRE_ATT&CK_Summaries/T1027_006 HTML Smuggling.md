# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using HTML Smuggling

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by exploiting vulnerabilities associated with HTML smuggling. Specifically, it focuses on identifying and mitigating threat actors leveraging this method to evade detection while exfiltrating sensitive data or executing payloads.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring for unusual patterns in web traffic and file uploads that are indicative of HTML smuggling. Key data sources include network traffic logs, web server logs, and endpoint monitoring systems. The strategy analyzes anomalies such as unexpected URL parameters, suspicious POST requests containing embedded scripts or payloads, and irregularities in user-agent strings.

## Technical Context

Adversaries utilize HTML smuggling by embedding malicious code within HTML tags sent through email attachments or web forms. This technique exploits the trust relationship between different web applications to execute unauthorized actions without detection.

### Adversary Emulation Details

- **Sample Commands:** Attackers might use JavaScript or other scripting languages embedded in HTML attributes.
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Crafting an email with a maliciously constructed HTML attachment.
  - Simulating a user submitting a web form containing hidden script tags designed to execute when processed by another application.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- Detection assumes that standard security monitoring is in place and operational across all potential vectors of attack.
- The strategy may not account for highly sophisticated evasion techniques that involve dynamic payload generation or use of zero-day vulnerabilities.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate web forms containing JavaScript intended for client-side processing.
- Email attachments with embedded HTML used for marketing purposes, which contain interactive elements such as scripts.

## Priority

**High**: The technique poses a significant risk due to its potential to bypass multiple layers of security controls silently. Organizations should prioritize detection mechanisms against this vector to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions: HTML Smuggling Remote Payload

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Configure a controlled test environment with network monitoring tools.
   - Deploy web applications that accept user input through forms or email attachments.

2. **Craft Malicious Payload:**
   - Create an email containing an HTML attachment with embedded JavaScript designed to execute when processed by another application.
   - Example script: `<input type="hidden" name="payload" value="<script>malicious_code()</script>" />`

3. **Simulate User Actions:**
   - Send the crafted email to a test mailbox within your controlled environment.
   - Use automated scripts to simulate user submission of forms containing similar embedded payloads.

4. **Monitor and Analyze Traffic:**
   - Capture network traffic using packet sniffing tools to identify unusual POST requests or HTTP headers.
   - Examine web server logs for anomalies related to script execution from unexpected sources.

5. **Evaluate Detection Systems:**
   - Verify if the monitoring systems detect the crafted payloads as suspicious activities.
   - Adjust detection rules and thresholds based on findings to improve accuracy.

## Response

When an alert fires indicating potential HTML smuggling:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate affected endpoints or web applications from the network to prevent further exploitation.
   - Disable user accounts that triggered the alerts until investigation is complete.

2. **Investigate and Validate:**
   - Examine logs for detailed context on the source of suspicious activity.
   - Confirm whether detected patterns align with known malicious behaviors.

3. **Remediate:**
   - Patch vulnerabilities in web applications or email clients used to process HTML content.
   - Update security policies and detection rules to mitigate future incidents.

4. **Report and Review:**
   - Document the incident, including findings, actions taken, and lessons learned.
   - Share insights with relevant stakeholders to improve overall security posture.
