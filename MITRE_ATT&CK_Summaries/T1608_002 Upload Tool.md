# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using containers as a means of concealing malicious activities within legitimate processes.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of data sources such as network traffic logs, container orchestration tool logs, and host system activity monitoring. The primary patterns analyzed include unusual or unauthorized container deployments, unexpected network communications originating from containers, and anomalous file transfers between containers and the host system.

Key indicators for detection:
- Unusual spikes in resource usage by containers.
- Containers attempting to connect to suspicious external IP addresses.
- File operations that deviate significantly from established baselines.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to encapsulate tools or scripts designed to facilitate further attacks. In practice, they might deploy a container with the sole purpose of evading detection mechanisms by running in isolated environments, often mimicking legitimate services.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- **Sample Commands:** Adversaries could utilize commands like `docker run --rm -d malicious-image` to spin up ephemeral containers that execute and then destroy themselves.
- **Test Scenarios:** Deploy a benign container but with network communication patterns or file operations similar to known malicious behavior.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Known Limitations:**
  - Legitimate use of containers for high-frequency, short-lived tasks could generate false positives.
  - Some sophisticated adversaries might still evade detection by mimicking normal container usage patterns closely.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Baselines for legitimate activity have been accurately established and continuously updated.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Automated deployment of containers in a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- Legitimate use of containerized applications in development environments where transient behavior is expected.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the exploitation of containers poses significant risks, such as allowing adversaries to conceal malicious tools and activities, it generally requires a certain level of sophistication. The potential impact is substantial if successfully exploited but is balanced by existing defensive controls that can mitigate risk when properly configured.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install Docker or another container orchestration platform.
   - Configure logging and monitoring tools for the host and network traffic.

2. **Deploy Malicious Container:**
   - Use `docker pull` to retrieve a benign image designed to mimic suspicious activity (e.g., frequent external connections).
   - Run the container using `docker run --rm -d <image-name>` with parameters that simulate malicious behavior.

3. **Simulate Activity:**
   - Configure the container to attempt connections to external IP addresses known for command and control activities.
   - Execute scripts within the container that generate anomalous file access patterns.

4. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Verify if detection systems trigger alerts based on the configured indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   - Review logs for unauthorized or suspicious activity corresponding to the emulated attack pattern.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Alert Validity:** Confirm whether the detected activity aligns with known malicious patterns or benign anomalies.
2. **Contain Activity:** If malicious intent is suspected, isolate affected containers and hosts to prevent further spread of potential threats.
3. **Investigate Origin:** Trace back the source of the container deployment to identify possible adversary infiltration vectors.
4. **Document Findings:** Record all observations and remediation steps taken for future reference and improvement of detection strategies.
