# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Pass the Hash (T1550.002)

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by exploiting credential misuse via the "Pass the Hash" technique on Windows platforms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1550.002 - Pass the Hash
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing various data sources within the Windows environment to detect "Pass the Hash" activities. The primary data sources include:

- **Event Logs:** Particularly those related to authentication (such as Event ID 4624) to track successful logins with hashed credentials.
- **Network Traffic:** Monitoring for unusual or unauthorized remote procedure calls (RPCs), which may indicate credential misuse.
- **Process Activity:** Detecting suspicious process creation that is associated with known tools used in "Pass the Hash" attacks, like Mimikatz and Invoke-WMIExec.

Patterns analyzed include anomalous login attempts from unexpected sources, repeated authentication failures followed by success without password change, and unusual network activity involving known ports for lateral movement.

## Technical Context

Adversaries execute the "Pass the Hash" technique to authenticate with a remote system using only the hash of an accountâ€™s NTLM credentials, bypassing the need for passwords. This is often done after obtaining credential hashes through tools like Mimikatz or exploiting vulnerabilities that leak hashed credentials.

### Adversary Emulation Details

**Sample Commands:**

- **Mimikatz:** 
  ```shell
  mimikatz.exe "sekurlsa::logonpasswords"
  ```
  
- **crackmapexec Pass the Hash:**
  ```shell
  crackmapexec smb <target_ip> -u 'username' -H <hash>
  ```

- **Invoke-WMIExec:**
  ```powershell
  Invoke-WMIExec -ComputerName <target_ip> -Credential (New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ('username', (ConvertTo-SecureString -String '<NTLM_HASH>' -AsPlainText -Force)))
  ```

### Test Scenarios

1. **Emulate Local Exploitation:** Use Mimikatz to extract hashed credentials from a compromised machine.
2. **Simulate Remote Access:** Attempt to use extracted hashes to access other systems within the network using tools like crackmapexec or Invoke-WMIExec.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not cover all potential tools used for "Pass the Hash" that aren't widely recognized.
  - Encrypted communication channels can obscure credential exchange, hindering detection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment logs necessary events in sufficient detail.
  - Security controls are sufficiently granular to identify unauthorized access attempts effectively.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate remote administration tools executing actions with elevated privileges within the network.
- Scheduled tasks or services using hashed credentials for operations, which may be misinterpreted as malicious activity if context is not properly analyzed.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The "Pass the Hash" technique allows adversaries to evade password protection mechanisms entirely, facilitating lateral movement and further exploitation. Its ability to bypass traditional authentication controls poses a significant threat to network security.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Set Up Test Environment:** Prepare isolated Windows machines with monitoring tools in place.
2. **Extract Hashes:**
   - Run Mimikatz on the target machine:
     ```shell
     mimikatz.exe "sekurlsa::logonpasswords"
     ```
3. **Simulate Remote Access:**
   - Use crackmapexec to attempt access from another machine:
     ```shell
     crackmapexec smb <target_ip> -u 'username' -H <hash>
     ```
   - Alternatively, use Invoke-WMIExec for similar results.
4. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Track logs for unusual login attempts (Event ID 4624).
   - Observe network traffic for unexpected RPCs or lateral movements.

## Response

When the alert fires:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Investigate Logs:** Examine event logs, process activity, and network traffic for signs of "Pass the Hash" usage.
3. **Credential Reset:** Change passwords and rehash credentials where applicable.
4. **Incident Documentation:** Record findings and response actions for future reference.
