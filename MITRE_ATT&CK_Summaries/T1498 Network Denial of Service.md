# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves detecting tactics where adversaries exploit container environments to conceal malicious activities and evade traditional monitoring systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a multi-source data approach to identify anomalous behaviors associated with the use of containers for adversarial purposes. Key data sources include:
- **Container Logs:** Monitoring logs from Docker, Kubernetes, and other container orchestration systems.
- **Network Traffic:** Analyzing network traffic patterns that deviate from typical behavior.
- **Endpoint Detection:** Observing host-level activities on systems running containers.

Patterns analyzed include unusual resource utilization spikes, unexpected network connections originating from containerized applications, and anomalies in container lifecycle events such as creation or destruction.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to create ephemeral environments that can quickly launch attacks while minimizing detection. They exploit the lightweight nature of containers to deploy malicious workloads rapidly and evade traditional security controls. Common tactics include:
- Running malicious payloads within containers.
- Using container escape techniques to gain host-level access.
- Employing orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage large-scale botnets.

Adversary emulation can involve executing commands such as `docker run -d --rm <malicious_image>` or deploying scripts that automate the creation and destruction of containers to test detection capabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss advanced evasion techniques, such as those involving encrypted payloads within container images.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that baseline behaviors for normal container usage are well-defined and monitored.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate high-load scenarios in development environments where containers are frequently created and destroyed.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks that involve container management.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to detect adversarial use of containers is critical due to the increasing adoption of containerized applications across various platforms. The potential for significant impact if adversaries succeed in evading detection justifies a high priority level.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are currently not available. Future efforts should focus on developing controlled scenarios that safely replicate adversarial behaviors using containers.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm the legitimacy of the detected activity by reviewing logs and network traffic.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread of potential threats.
3. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the scope and intent of the detected activity.
4. **Remediation:** Implement necessary changes to security controls to address vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.

Additional references and context are currently not available. Future updates may include links to case studies, academic papers, or industry reports that provide deeper insights into container-based adversarial tactics.
