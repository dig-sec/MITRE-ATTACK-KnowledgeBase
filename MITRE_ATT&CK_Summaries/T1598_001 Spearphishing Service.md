# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1598.001 - Spearphishing Service
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Preparation, Readiness, Execution)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous activities related to container deployment and network communication patterns that may indicate an adversary's attempt to bypass security measures. Data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- Network traffic analysis
- User activity monitoring

Patterns analyzed involve unusual spikes in resource usage, unexpected changes in network configuration, or unauthorized access attempts via containerized services.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to hide malicious activities by leveraging their ephemeral nature and isolation features. In real-world scenarios, adversaries deploy containers with pre-configured payloads that communicate with external command-and-control servers. Common tactics include:
- Deploying containers with compromised images
- Using sidecar containers for covert communication

**Sample Commands:**
```bash
docker pull malicious/image
docker run --rm -d --name hidden-service malicious/image
```

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Set up a container environment.
2. Deploy a container using a known malicious image.
3. Monitor network traffic and logs for unusual activity.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into encrypted container communications, difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate and malicious container usage without context.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that baseline behavior is well-understood and deviations are accurately flagged as suspicious.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate deployment of new services using containers.
- Network traffic spikes due to scheduled maintenance or updates.
- Authorized testing environments where unusual activity is expected.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The use of containers for malicious purposes can significantly undermine security monitoring and provide adversaries with a stealthy method to operate within an environment, making early detection crucial.

## Response
When the alert fires:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected container instances to prevent further spread.
2. **Investigation:** Examine logs and network traffic for signs of malicious activity or unauthorized access.
3. **Remediation:** Remove compromised containers and images, and review security policies for potential gaps.
4. **Notification:** Inform relevant stakeholders and update incident response plans as necessary.

## Additional Resources
- None available
