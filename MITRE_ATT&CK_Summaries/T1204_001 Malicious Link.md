# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by leveraging container technologies. This includes identifying scenarios where adversaries use containers as a vector to execute malicious activities while evading traditional detection systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container activities across diverse environments. Key data sources include container runtime logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), network traffic associated with container orchestration platforms, and file integrity monitoring of the host system. Patterns analyzed include unusual command execution within containers, unexpected network connections initiated by container processes, and anomalies in container image pulls or deployments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit containers to execute malicious payloads due to their isolated nature and scalability. In real-world scenarios, adversaries may deploy malware-laden images on compromised registries or hijack legitimate services running within containers to conduct attacks stealthily. Commands commonly observed include:
- Pulling an image from a suspicious registry: `docker pull malicious/image`
- Executing commands within a container that interact with sensitive data

Adversary emulation can involve setting up controlled test environments where benign containers are manipulated to mimic these behaviors, ensuring detection mechanisms capture the necessary signals without impacting legitimate operations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss highly sophisticated evasion techniques that leverage zero-day vulnerabilities within container runtimes.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes baseline security policies for network segmentation and image vetting are in place. Also assumes logging mechanisms are fully enabled and configured to capture all relevant events.

## False Positives
Potential false positives might include:
- Legitimate usage of containers for dynamic resource allocation or CI/CD pipelines.
- Network traffic spikes due to legitimate software updates or deployments within the containerized environment.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
The use of containers by adversaries poses a significant risk as they can provide an additional layer of obfuscation, potentially leading to widespread compromise if left undetected. Given their increasing adoption in modern IT environments, prioritizing detection and monitoring is essential.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

## Response
Upon detection:
1. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers immediately to prevent further spread.
2. **Analysis:** Investigate the nature of the detected activity, reviewing logs for any indicators of compromise (IOCs).
3. **Remediation:** Remove malicious container images and apply necessary patches or updates to prevent recurrence.
4. **Communication:** Notify relevant stakeholders about the breach and potential impact.

## Additional Resources

This strategy is intended as a framework for organizations looking to enhance their detection capabilities against adversarial attempts using container technologies, ensuring robust security postures in dynamic environments.
