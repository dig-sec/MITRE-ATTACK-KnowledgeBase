# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This includes identifying tactics where adversaries leverage containerization to obscure malicious activities and evade traditional network defenses.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1600.001 - Reduce Key Space
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Network

For more details, refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/001).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources including network traffic logs, container orchestration platform events (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), and endpoint detection outputs. Patterns analyzed include unusual network traffic originating from containers, unexpected creation or modification of container images, unauthorized use of specific ports, and anomalies in resource usage indicative of malicious behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit containerization to bypass security controls by creating isolated environments that are difficult to monitor with traditional tools. In real-world scenarios, attackers may deploy malicious payloads within containers, execute unauthorized activities, or leverage legitimate services running inside containers to obfuscate their actions.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - Attacker might use `docker run --rm -d -p 8080:80 my-malicious-image` to deploy a malicious container.
  - Using Kubernetes, they may execute `kubectl run malicious-pod --image=my-malicious-image`.

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Monitor network traffic for unexpected outbound connections from containers.
  - Set alerts for unauthorized deployment or modification of container images.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** 
  - Difficulty in distinguishing between benign and malicious use of containers due to their legitimate use cases.
  - High volume of data can lead to alert fatigue if not properly tuned.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Organizations have implemented a baseline level of container monitoring.
  - Analysts are familiar with normal behavior patterns within the organization's containerized environment.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployments or updates to container images during maintenance windows.
- Network traffic spikes associated with legitimate application scaling events.
- Authorized use of containers for development and testing purposes, which may mimic adversarial behavior.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability of adversaries to exploit containerization technologies to bypass security measures poses a significant threat. Containers are increasingly used in enterprise environments, making this technique both relevant and potentially damaging if not detected promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions for emulation are available. However, organizations should consider developing their own scenarios based on typical container deployment practices to validate detection capabilities.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected container(s) from the network.
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the container's activities and logs.
   - Review recent changes or deployments that might have introduced vulnerabilities.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Determine if the activity is malicious or benign by correlating with other security events.
   - Engage in threat hunting to identify any lateral movement or further exploitation attempts.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Patch identified vulnerabilities and strengthen container orchestration policies.
   - Update detection rules to reduce false positives without compromising on sensitivity.

## Additional Resources
No additional resources are currently available. Organizations should leverage existing cybersecurity frameworks and best practices for container security, such as those provided by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmarks or Docker's own security guidelines.

This report outlines a structured approach using Palantir's ADS framework to detect adversarial attempts leveraging containers for defense evasion. By focusing on key data sources and patterns, organizations can enhance their ability to identify and respond to these sophisticated threats.
