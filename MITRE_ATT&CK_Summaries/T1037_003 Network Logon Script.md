# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using container technologies. This involves identifying activities where adversaries deploy containers as a means to obfuscate their operations and evade detection from traditional security systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1037.003 - Network Logon Script
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of log analysis and behavioral monitoring to identify anomalous container usage. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- Host system event logs
- Network traffic patterns

The strategy focuses on detecting unusual patterns such as:
- Creation of containers in non-standard directories
- Containers with escalated privileges or access to sensitive resources
- High-frequency container creation and deletion activities
- Unusual network communication from containerized applications

By analyzing these data sources, the system aims to identify potential evasion attempts that may indicate malicious intent.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit container technologies to bypass security monitoring by using them as a means to isolate malicious payloads or execute commands without detection. This can involve:
- Creating containers with elevated privileges
- Using containers to run scripts or executables that evade traditional endpoint protection tools

### Adversary Emulation Details
In real-world scenarios, adversaries might use commands such as:
```bash
docker run --rm -v /etc/passwd:/root/.passwd:ro ubuntu bash -c "cat /root/.passwd"
```
This command demonstrates how an adversary might attempt to access sensitive files using a container.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may be limited if adversaries use advanced obfuscation techniques within containers.
  - Monitoring tools not integrated with the container orchestration environment may miss relevant activities.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The system assumes that baseline behavior for legitimate container usage is well-defined and monitored.
  - Security policies are in place to restrict unauthorized access to container management interfaces.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate high-frequency deployment of containers during development or testing phases.
- Authorized use of containers for privileged operations by system administrators.
- Network traffic from containers involved in legitimate services (e.g., microservices architecture).

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring poses a significant threat as it can lead to undetected persistence and privilege escalation within the network. Containers are increasingly used in modern environments, making this technique particularly relevant.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should quickly assess the context of the container activity.
2. **Containment:** If malicious intent is suspected, isolate affected containers to prevent further spread.
3. **Analysis:** Examine logs and network traffic for indicators of compromise (IoCs).
4. **Remediation:** Remove unauthorized containers and review access controls.
5. **Reporting:** Document findings and update security policies as necessary.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
