- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing network traffic, system logs, and application behavior within containerized environments. By leveraging data from these sources, the strategy aims to identify patterns indicative of unauthorized lateral movements using Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) protocols. The approach involves setting up alerts for unusual activity such as unexpected DCOM connections or attempts to establish trust relationships with remote systems.

### Data Sources
- Network traffic logs
- System event logs
- Container runtime logs

### Patterns Analyzed
- Unusual inter-container communication
- Suspicious DCOM usage patterns
- Anomalies in container startup sequences

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) to move laterally across networks, leveraging its capabilities to interact with remote systems as if they were local. This technique is particularly challenging to detect because DCOM traffic often blends with legitimate administrative activities on Windows platforms.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `wmic /node:"<RemoteMachineName>" process call create notepad.exe`
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Simulate lateral movement by initiating a remote process execution via DCOM from within a container to another machine on the network.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes all containers are properly isolated, which may not always be true in misconfigured environments.
- Potential blind spots include encrypted DCOM traffic that bypasses standard monitoring tools.
- Relies on accurate log collection and analysis, assuming no tampering has occurred.

## False Positives
- Legitimate administrative tasks using DCOM for remote management might trigger false alerts.
- Network segmentation changes or legitimate updates to container configurations could be misinterpreted as malicious activity.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
- The technique targets a critical Windows infrastructure component, which if compromised, can lead to significant unauthorized access and data exfiltration. 
- Containers are increasingly used in enterprise environments, amplifying the potential impact of successful attacks exploiting this vector.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### PowerShell Lateral Movement using MMC20
1. Set up a test environment with Windows-based containers.
2. Deploy a container running PowerShell on the target machine.
3. Use the command `Start-Process -ComputerName <TargetMachine> -Credential <Credential> mmc.exe` to attempt lateral movement via MMC.

### PowerShell Lateral Movement Using Excel Application Object
1. Prepare an Excel file with malicious macro code.
2. Distribute the Excel file within a container environment and instruct it to open on a target machine using DCOM.
3. Monitor for execution of unauthorized commands or scripts.

## Response
When alerts are triggered:
- Immediately isolate affected containers to prevent further lateral movement.
- Conduct a detailed investigation into the source and nature of the suspicious activity.
- Review recent changes in container configurations and network policies.
- Update security controls to mitigate potential vulnerabilities identified during the response process.
