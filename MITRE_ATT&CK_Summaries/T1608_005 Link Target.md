# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the exploitation of container technologies. This involves detecting unauthorized activities that leverage containers for malicious purposes, such as executing commands or deploying payloads.

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on identifying unusual or unauthorized activities within container environments. The primary data sources include:

- Container runtime logs
- Network traffic associated with containers
- Host system activity logs

Patterns analyzed include unexpected resource consumption, anomalous inter-container communication, and deviations from baseline behavior of containerized applications.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may use containers to obfuscate their activities, exploit the dynamic nature of container lifecycles, or bypass traditional security controls. In practice, they might:

- Deploy malicious containers on compromised hosts.
- Use container orchestration tools to scale and persist unauthorized operations.
- Exploit vulnerabilities within container images.

### Adversary Emulation Details

Sample commands or scenarios for testing may include:

- Deploying a benign container with elevated privileges to simulate an attack vector.
- Executing network scans from within a containerized environment.
- Manipulating container orchestration configurations to test detection efficacy.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss highly sophisticated attacks that mimic normal container operations. Additionally, encrypted or obfuscated communications within containers can evade pattern recognition.
  
- **Assumptions:** Assumes baseline behavior models are accurate and regularly updated. It also assumes comprehensive logging of all relevant data sources.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:

- Legitimate high-resource applications running in containers that deviate from typical usage patterns.
- Network testing or penetration exercises conducted by internal security teams using containerized tools.

## Priority

**Priority Level: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used both for legitimate purposes and as vectors for attacks. The potential impact of undetected adversarial activity leveraging container technology justifies a high priority in detection efforts.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. Deploy a benign container with administrative privileges on a test host.
2. Simulate unauthorized network scanning using tools like `nmap` from within the container.
3. Monitor and log all interactions, including resource usage and inter-container communications.

*(Note: No specific validation steps are currently available beyond general emulation guidelines.)*

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Temporarily isolate the affected containers to prevent potential spread or escalation of malicious activities.
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Review logs for unusual patterns and cross-reference with known indicators of compromise (IOCs).
3. **Root Cause Investigation:** Determine if the activity was due to a misconfiguration, legitimate use case, or adversarial action.
4. **Remediation and Reporting:** Implement necessary fixes, update detection models, and document findings for future reference.

## Additional Resources

- None available

This ADS framework outlines a structured approach to detecting and responding to container-based adversarial activities, ensuring that security teams can effectively monitor and mitigate potential threats in dynamic environments.
