# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. This involves identifying when adversaries use containers as an execution environment to obscure their activities and evade detection systems that are not configured to monitor these environments effectively.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Network

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring containerized environments for unusual activity that indicates potential adversarial behavior. The primary data sources include container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker), system logs, network traffic analysis, and endpoint detection systems.

Patterns analyzed will include:
- Unusual creation or modification of containers.
- Execution of suspicious binaries within containers.
- Network traffic originating from containers to known malicious IP addresses.
- Unauthorized changes to container configurations or images.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers due to their lightweight nature and ease of deployment, which can be leveraged to evade detection by traditional security solutions. In real-world scenarios, adversaries might:
- Deploy containers with malicious payloads using legitimate processes.
- Use ephemeral containers for command-and-control (C2) communication.
- Modify container images to include malware or exploit vulnerabilities.

Adversary emulation details may involve commands like `docker run -it --rm <malicious_image>` to execute a container with malicious intent, or the use of Kubernetes configurations to deploy containers across distributed environments stealthily.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection might not cover all types of container technologies.
  - Encrypted traffic within containers may evade network-based detection.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Security systems are configured to monitor container activities.
  - Baselines for normal container activity have been established.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers by developers or system administrators for testing purposes.
- Automated deployment scripts that create and destroy containers as part of regular operations.
- Network traffic from containers to public cloud services for legitimate API calls.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

The severity is assessed as high due to the increasing adoption of container technologies in both development and production environments, coupled with their potential use by adversaries to bypass traditional security controls. The stealthy nature of these attacks makes them particularly dangerous if undetected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### AutoIt Script Execution
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Setup:**
   - Deploy a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes.
   - Ensure network monitoring and logging are enabled for the containers.

2. **Emulate Adversarial Behavior:**
   - Create an AutoIt script that automates the deployment of a malicious container:
     ```autoit
     ; Sample AutoIt Script to run a Docker container with a suspicious image
     Run("docker pull suspicious_image")
     Sleep(1000)
     Run("docker run --rm suspicious_image", @SW_HIDE)
     ```

3. **Execute:**
   - Run the AutoIt script in an environment where you have permission to deploy containers.
   - Monitor for alerts or logs indicating unusual container activity.

4. **Analyze:**
   - Review logs from the orchestration platform and network traffic analysis tools for signs of detection.
   - Validate that the system correctly identifies the suspicious activity.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate the affected containers to prevent further malicious activities.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and impact of the incident.
- Review container images and configurations for any unauthorized changes or embedded threats.
- Update security policies and monitoring rules to mitigate future risks associated with container misuse.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently not available. Analysts should consult up-to-date resources on container security best practices and threat intelligence reports for further guidance.
