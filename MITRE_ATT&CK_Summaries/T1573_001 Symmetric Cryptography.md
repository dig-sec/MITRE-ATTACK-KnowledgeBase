# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of Symmetric Cryptography (MITRE ATT&CK T1573.001)

## Goal

The goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to use symmetric cryptography as a means of obfuscating command and control communications or other sensitive data, thereby bypassing security monitoring mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1573.001 - Symmetric Cryptography
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis, file system monitoring, and process inspection across multiple platforms to identify the use of symmetric cryptography tools and techniques. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic:** Capture encrypted traffic patterns that deviate from normal baselines.
- **File System Monitoring:** Detect the creation or modification of files with cryptographic signatures.
- **Process Inspection:** Identify processes executing known cryptographic libraries or functions.

Patterns analyzed include unusual encryption activity, such as repeated generation of random keys, execution of symmetric key algorithms without corresponding decryption routines, and network connections to suspicious endpoints using encrypted channels.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use symmetric cryptography to encrypt command and control communications or exfiltrate data. This technique is favored for its speed and efficiency compared to asymmetric methods. In practice, adversaries may employ tools like OpenSSL, GnuPG, or custom scripts to generate encryption keys and encrypt payloads. These activities can be detected by monitoring for:

- Execution of cryptographic libraries (e.g., `libcrypto`, `CryptoAPI`).
- Use of command-line tools with options indicative of encryption (e.g., `-encrypt`, `-symmetric`).
- Generation of large volumes of random data, often used as keys or initialization vectors.

### Adversary Emulation Details

Sample commands that might be used by adversaries include:

- **Linux:** `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in plaintext.txt -out encrypted.bin`
- **Windows:** `gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 file.txt`
- **macOS:** `openssl enc -aes-256-gcm -in data.txt -out secure.dat`

Test scenarios can involve simulating these commands in a controlled environment to observe the resulting system behavior and network traffic.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not cover custom or proprietary encryption methods.
  - Encrypted traffic without unusual patterns might evade detection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Normal baseline activities are well-defined and monitored.
  - Cryptographic tools are used in a manner consistent with known command structures.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of encryption for data protection or compliance (e.g., encrypting backup files).
- Routine cryptographic operations by software applications (e.g., VPN clients, secure messaging apps).

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: The use of symmetric cryptography by adversaries can significantly undermine detection capabilities and facilitate unauthorized access to sensitive information. Early detection is crucial to prevent data exfiltration or command and control communication.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no specific adversary emulation instructions are available for this technique. However, organizations should consider developing their own test scenarios based on the provided sample commands and observed behaviors in a controlled environment.

## Response

When an alert related to symmetric cryptography is triggered:

1. **Analyze Context:** Review associated processes, network connections, and file modifications.
2. **Correlate Events:** Check for other indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as unusual login attempts or data transfers.
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread or communication with command and control servers.
4. **Eradication:** Remove malicious tools or scripts used for encryption.
5. **Recovery:** Restore affected systems from clean backups and ensure all cryptographic keys are invalidated if compromised.
