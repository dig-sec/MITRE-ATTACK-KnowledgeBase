# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Indirect Command Execution

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through indirect command execution on Windows systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying indirect command execution attempts using various native and third-party tools. Key data sources include process monitoring, file integrity checks, and event logs. Patterns analyzed involve unusual parent-child process relationships, unexpected usage of system utilities (e.g., `pcalua.exe`, `forfiles.exe`), and anomalous script executions.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often execute indirect commands to evade detection by executing payloads in an environment that does not directly raise alerts. This can be achieved using tools like `pcalua.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and custom scripts that invoke system utilities with command-line arguments, thereby obscuring the true intent of the execution.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Pcalua.exe:** Adversaries use this to execute commands indirectly by leveraging its capability to launch applications.
  - Sample Command: `pcalua /a "cmd.exe" /c "net user"`
- **Forfiles.exe:** Used for executing scripts based on file timestamps, which can be leveraged for malicious purposes.
  - Sample Command: `forfiles /p C:\path\to\malicious\file /m *.* /c "cmd /c start cmd.exe"`
- **Conhost.exe:** Involved in redirecting console output to evade logging mechanisms.
  - Scenario: Launch a command using `cmd.exe` redirected through `conhost.exe`.
- **Scriptrunner.exe:** Executes scripts with elevated privileges, often used by attackers for persistence and evasion.
  - Sample Command: `scriptrunner.exe run malicious_script.ps1`
- **RunMRU Dialog:** Exploits the Run Most Recently Used dialog to execute commands without direct user input.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection may not cover all variants of indirect execution, especially those using custom or less common utilities.
- Assumes that security tools have comprehensive visibility into process creation and command-line arguments.
- May miss sophisticated evasion techniques that obfuscate command-line parameters beyond simple encoding or redirection.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of system utilities for administrative tasks (e.g., `forfiles.exe` for maintenance scripts).
- Scheduled tasks using similar execution patterns.
- User-initiated processes involving known safe applications but with complex command-line arguments.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Indirect command execution is a common technique used by adversaries to bypass security controls and execute malicious payloads. Its stealthy nature makes it particularly dangerous, as it can facilitate further compromise without immediate detection.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe
```shell
pcalua /a "cmd.exe" /c "net user"
```
- Monitor for unexpected `pcalua.exe` executions targeting system utilities like `cmd.exe`.

#### 2. Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe
```shell
forfiles /p C:\path\to\malicious\file /m *.* /c "cmd /c start cmd.exe"
```
- Look for unusual usage patterns of `forfiles.exe` that target executable files or scripts.

#### 3. Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe
```shell
start "" cmd.exe | conhost.exe
```
- Detect attempts to redirect console output through `conhost.exe`.

#### 4. Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe
```shell
scriptrunner.exe run malicious_script.ps1
```
- Identify executions of scripts with elevated privileges using `scriptrunner.exe`.

#### 5. Indirect Command Execution - RunMRU Dialog
- Simulate exploitation by accessing the Run MRU list and executing commands without direct user input.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of process trees to identify any anomalies or unauthorized executions.
- Review logs for evidence of indirect command execution patterns.
- Update security controls to mitigate similar future attempts and refine detection rules based on findings.

## Additional Resources
- **Potentially Suspicious PowerShell Child Processes:** Investigate unusual parent-child relationships in PowerShell processes.
- **Use of Scriptrunner.exe:** Monitor for elevated script executions that could indicate privilege escalation attempts.
- **Forfiles Command Execution:** Analyze patterns of `forfiles.exe` usage to distinguish between benign and malicious activities.
- **Use of Pcalua For Execution:** Scrutinize instances where `pcalua.exe` is used in conjunction with other system utilities.

By implementing this ADS framework, organizations can enhance their detection capabilities against indirect command execution techniques, thereby strengthening their overall security posture.
