# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Kernel Modules

## **Goal**
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using kernel modules on macOS and Linux platforms. These actions can compromise system integrity, allowing adversaries to achieve persistence or escalate privileges.

## **Categorization**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1547.006 - Kernel Modules and Extensions
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** macOS, Linux

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/006)

## **Strategy Abstract**
The detection strategy leverages various data sources such as system logs, kernel audit trails, and process monitoring tools to identify unauthorized loading of kernel modules. Key patterns analyzed include unexpected module loads or modifications in kernel configurations that deviate from normal behavior.

- **Data Sources:**
  - System Logs (e.g., syslog, dmesg)
  - Kernel Audit Trails
  - Process Monitoring Tools
  - Integrity Checking Services

- **Patterns Analyzed:**
  - Unauthorized kernel module loads.
  - Modifications in system integrity configuration files.
  - Anomalous execution of commands typically associated with kernel module management.

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries may exploit kernel modules to gain elevated access and bypass security mechanisms. In Linux, this can be executed using `insmod` or similar commands. On macOS, adversaries might use `kextload`, `kmutil`, or the API function `KextManagerLoadKextWithURL()`.

**Real-World Execution:**
1. **Linux:** Adversaries execute `sudo insmod /path/to/module.ko` to load malicious kernel modules.
2. **macOS:**
   - Use `kextload` command: `sudo kextload /Library/Extensions/malicious.kext`
   - Utilize `kmutil`: `sudo kmutil load /Path/to/Malicious.kext`
   - Leverage the API function for stealthier loading.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - Linux: `insmod`, `rmmod`
  - macOS: `kextload`, `kmutil`

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- **Assumptions:** Detection is based on known command patterns and typical module locations. New or obfuscated techniques may bypass detection.
- **Limitations:** 
  - Legitimate system updates or custom software installations could introduce benign kernel modules that mimic malicious behavior.
  - Highly skilled adversaries might avoid logging through advanced evasion techniques.

## **False Positives**
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate system updates introducing new kernel modules.
- Administrator-initiated maintenance tasks involving kernel module loading.
- Software installations requiring kernel extensions for functionality (e.g., drivers).

## **Priority**
**Severity: High**

**Justification:** Kernel-level access provides adversaries with significant control over the system, allowing them to bypass security measures, achieve persistence, and perform malicious activities undetected.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**
To validate detection strategies in a controlled environment:

### Linux
1. **Load Kernel Module:**
   - Execute: `sudo insmod /usr/local/src/module.ko`
2. Monitor logs for unexpected module loads using:
   - `dmesg | grep module`

### macOS
1. **Using kextload:**
   - Load a module: `sudo kextload /Library/Extensions/malicious.kext`
   - Monitor with: `kextstat | grep malicious`
   
2. **Using kmutil:**
   - Execute: `sudo kmutil load /Path/to/Malicious.kext`

3. **Via API (KextManagerLoadKextWithURL()):**
   - Use developer tools to call the function programmatically.

4. **Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin:**
   - Simulate loading using custom scripts or emulation frameworks designed for macOS kernel testing.

## **Response**
When an alert is triggered:
1. Immediately isolate affected systems from the network.
2. Verify the legitimacy of the loaded modules by cross-referencing with known good baselines and update lists.
3. Conduct a thorough investigation to assess any changes made by the module, including system integrity checks.
4. Remove unauthorized kernel modules using `rmmod` or equivalent commands.
5. Update detection signatures based on findings to improve future accuracy.

## **Additional Resources**
- Refer to [Execution Of Script Located In Potentially Suspicious Directory](https://example.com) for insights into script execution patterns and mitigation strategies.
- Utilize integrity checking tools like Tripwire for Linux or System Integrity Protection (SIP) for macOS.
- Regularly review system logs and audit trails for anomalies.

By following this structured approach, organizations can enhance their capability to detect and respond to kernel module exploitation attempts effectively.
