# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the use of encoded data in containerized environments.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring network traffic for patterns of encoded data that adversaries often use to disguise command-and-control communications. Key data sources include network logs and application event logs. Patterns analyzed involve the presence of Base64 or XOR encoded strings, which are commonly used in adversarial payloads.

## Technical Context
Adversaries utilize encoding techniques such as Base64 and XOR to obfuscate their commands within legitimate-looking traffic to evade detection systems. These encoded payloads may be transmitted over network protocols like HTTP(S) using tools like `curl` on platforms including Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Base64 Encoded Data:** Adversaries use Base64 encoding to transform binary data into text that can be easily transported.
  - Sample Command: 
    ```bash
    echo "payload" | base64
    ```
  
- **XOR Encoded Data (Linux):** XOR encoding provides a simple obfuscation mechanism by applying the XOR bitwise operator with a key.
  - Sample Command:
    ```bash
    echo -n "payload" | xxd -p | tr -d '\n' | while IFS= read -r hex; do printf "\\x$hex"; done | xxd -ps | tr -d '\\'
    ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that encoded data is indicative of adversarial activity, which may not always be the case.
- **Blind Spots:** Legitimate applications using Base64 for data transfer might generate false positives. Also, custom encoding schemes are not accounted for.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Developers using Base64 to encode files or credentials during legitimate transfers.
- Use of automated tools that employ standard encoding for configuration management and deployment scripts.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While encoding is a common adversarial technique, its presence alone does not confirm malicious intent. However, the potential impact of undetected command-and-control communication warrants attention.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Steps to Emulate Encoding Techniques:
1. **Base64 Encoded Data:**
   - Command: 
     ```bash
     echo "sample data" | base64 > encoded.txt
     ```
   - Use the `encoded.txt` file in network traffic simulation for detection.

2. **Base64 Encoded Data (FreeBSD):**
   - Similar to Linux, use:
     ```bash
     echo "sample data" | base64 > encoded.txt
     ```

3. **XOR Encoded Data:**
   - Encode the string using a specific key:
     ```bash
     key='A'
     echo -n "sample data" | perl -e '$_=pack("H*",`echo -n "$^A sample data" | xxd -p`); print encode_base64($_)'
     ```
   - Simulate transmission in the network environment.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Verify Context:** Assess if the encoded data originates from a known and trusted source.
2. **Analyze Traffic Patterns:** Determine if there are unusual traffic patterns or destinations associated with the encoded payload.
3. **Incident Escalation:** If suspicious, escalate according to the organization's incident response protocol.
