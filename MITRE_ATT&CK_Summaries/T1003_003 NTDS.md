# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) for Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring using Volume Shadow Copies

## **Goal**
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) on Windows platforms. Specifically, it targets unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive files such as NTDS.dit, which contains hashed user credentials.

## **Categorization**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1003.003 - NTDS
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows

## **Strategy Abstract**
This detection strategy focuses on monitoring Volume Shadow Copy operations to identify unauthorized creation and access patterns. The primary data sources include event logs, process monitoring, and file access events. Key patterns analyzed involve:
- Unexpected creation of volume shadow copies.
- Access or modification of sensitive files like NTDS.dit from shadow copies.
- Use of administrative tools (e.g., `vssadmin`, `wmic.exe`) to manage shadow copies without legitimate administrative context.

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries exploit Volume Shadow Copy Service to create backups of system and user data, including the Active Directory database. This allows them to access sensitive information such as hashed passwords stored in NTDS.dit. Common methods include:
- Using commands like `vssadmin`, `wmic.exe`, or PowerShell scripts to create shadow copies.
- Accessing and extracting NTDS.dit from these backups for offline password cracking.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `vssadmin create shadow /for=C:`
  - `wmic /node:TARGET_MACHINE VSSADMIN CreateShadow`
  - PowerShell: `New-Snapshot -Volume "C:"`

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- Legitimate administrative actions creating shadow copies might not be detected.
- Encrypted or obfuscated commands could evade detection if signature-based methods are used.
- Assumes that all relevant event logs are enabled and properly configured.

## **False Positives**
Potential benign activities include:
- Scheduled system backups by IT personnel using Volume Shadow Copy.
- Routine maintenance tasks involving shadow copy creation.
- Legitimate use of administrative tools for system management.

## **Priority**
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to exfiltrate NTDS.dit can lead to a full compromise of domain credentials, granting adversaries extensive control over network resources. Early detection is crucial to prevent credential theft and subsequent lateral movement within the network.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**
To validate this technique in a controlled environment:

1. **Create Volume Shadow Copy with `vssadmin`:**
   - Run: `vssadmin create shadow /for=C:`

2. **Copy NTDS.dit from Volume Shadow Copy:**
   - Identify the shadow copy volume.
   - Use: `robocopy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopyX\Windows\system32\config NTDS.dit C:\Backup`

3. **Dump Active Directory Database with `NTDSUtil`:**
   - Run: `ntdsutil "ac i ntds" ifm "dump db" filename c:\ntds.dit full`

4. **Create Volume Shadow Copy with WMI:**
   - Run: `wmic /node:localhost VSSAdmin CreateShadow`

5. **Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely with WMI:**
   - Run: `wmic /node:TARGET_MACHINE VSSAdmin CreateShadow`

6. **Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely (WMI) with `esentutl`:**
   - Use `esentutl` to mount and copy NTDS.dit from the shadow copy.

7. **Create Volume Shadow Copy with PowerShell:**
   - Run: `New-Snapshot -Volume "C:"`

8. **Create Symlink to Volume Shadow Copy:**
   - Identify shadow copy path.
   - Use: `mklink /d LinkPath \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopyX\`

9. **Create Volume Shadow Copy with `diskshadow`:**
   - Run: `diskshadow`
   - Execute: `create shadow for c:`

## **Response**
When an alert is triggered:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the volume shadow copy creation.
2. Check for unauthorized access to NTDS.dit or other sensitive files.
3. Isolate affected systems and review logs for additional indicators of compromise.
4. Notify incident response teams and escalate as per organizational protocols.
