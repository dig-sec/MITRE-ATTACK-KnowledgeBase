# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Mavinject

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using the `Mavinject` malware delivery method, specifically in Windows environments.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1218.013 - Mavinject
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/013)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring for specific indicators associated with the deployment of `Mavinject`. This includes analyzing network traffic, process creation, and memory injection events. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic:** Look for unusual connections to known command-and-control (C2) servers.
- **Process Monitoring:** Identify unexpected processes related to `Mavinject` or suspicious parent-child relationships in process trees.
- **Memory Analysis:** Detect anomalies in memory injections, particularly those involving DLLs associated with malware delivery.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unexpected network connections from the machine.
- Execution of PowerShell scripts or other command-line tools that are known to be used by adversaries for deploying `Mavinject`.
- Suspicious DLL loading events indicative of reflective DLL injection techniques.

## Technical Context
Adversaries use `Mavinject` to evade detection by injecting malicious code into legitimate processes. This technique often involves:

- **Reflective DLL Injection:** Loading a DLL directly from memory without writing it to disk, thus bypassing file-based detections.
- **PowerShell Usage:** Employing PowerShell scripts to execute the injection process.

Adversaries typically leverage legitimate tools and exploit frameworks like Metasploit or Cobalt Strike to facilitate these injections. Sample commands used in adversary emulation might include:

```powershell
Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection -FileName "C:\path\to\malicious.dll" -TargetProcess "svchost.exe"
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover all variations of reflective DLL injection techniques.
  - Encrypted network traffic can obscure detection efforts.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The presence of certain processes or network connections is inherently suspicious.
  - Security tools have visibility into process memory and network traffic.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of PowerShell for administrative tasks.
- Network connections from trusted applications that may occasionally communicate with external servers.
- Reflective DLL loading by legitimate software development tools or processes.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
- `Mavinject` is a sophisticated technique used to evade traditional security controls, posing a significant threat to organizational assets.
- Its use in defense evasion indicates a high likelihood of subsequent malicious activities if undetected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available for emulating this technique. Analysts should consider:

- Setting up a controlled environment with monitoring tools capable of capturing network traffic and process memory.
- Using known adversary frameworks to simulate reflective DLL injection scenarios.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately disconnect from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Capture Forensic Data:** Collect relevant logs, memory dumps, and network captures for detailed analysis.
3. **Investigate Process Trees:** Examine parent-child process relationships to identify suspicious activities.
4. **Analyze Network Traffic:** Review connections to external servers for signs of C2 communication.
5. **Review Memory Dumps:** Look for injected DLLs or anomalous memory patterns.
