# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing containers in unsupported or unused cloud regions.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1535 - Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages cloud infrastructure telemetry to identify anomalous activities associated with the creation and deployment of containers in regions that are either unused or unsupported by the organization's security monitoring systems. Data sources include:
- Cloud provider logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs)
- Container orchestration platform metrics (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)

Patterns analyzed encompass:
- Creation of resources in unexpected or non-standard regions
- Unusual container deployment activities in these regions
- Traffic patterns indicating data exfiltration attempts

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit unused or unsupported cloud regions to evade detection. By deploying containers in such regions, they aim to operate outside the scope of standard security monitoring solutions. In practice, adversaries may use the following methods:
- Deploying containers with automated scripts that specify a non-standard region.
- Utilizing ephemeral container instances to minimize traceability.

Example command:
```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xxxxxx --region us-east-1a
```
(Note: `us-east-1a` might be an unused or unsupported region for certain organizations.)

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:
- Detection capability is dependent on the thorough integration of cloud provider logs with security monitoring tools.
- Assumes comprehensive visibility into all regions that are potentially active within the organization's cloud environment.

Gaps in detection may arise if:
- The attacker uses an entirely new region that has not been previously identified as unused or unsupported.
- Security monitoring systems do not have real-time access to cloud provider logging services.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate testing environments or development projects temporarily utilizing lesser-used regions.
- Misconfigurations in security policies leading to legitimate container deployments in non-standard regions without malicious intent.

## Priority
**High**: The severity is high due to the significant risk posed by adversaries successfully bypassing established security monitoring, potentially enabling data exfiltration and further lateral movement within the cloud environment.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:
1. Configure a test cloud account with access logging enabled.
2. Deploy containers using CLI commands specifying regions not typically used by your organization.
3. Observe logs for any activities associated with these deployments and verify detection mechanisms trigger alerts appropriately.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected resources to prevent potential data leakage.
- Review cloud provider logs to identify the scope of activity.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if this is part of a broader adversarial campaign.
- Update security policies to ensure all regions are adequately monitored and configured.
