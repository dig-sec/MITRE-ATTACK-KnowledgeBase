# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that aim to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by leveraging container technologies. This involves identifying and mitigating tactics where adversaries use containers as a means to execute malicious activities undetected within an enterprise environment.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy revolves around monitoring and analyzing container activity logs, network traffic associated with containers, and configurations of container orchestrators. Key data sources include:
- **Container Runtime Logs:** To identify unusual behaviors or unauthorized container deployments.
- **Network Traffic Data:** Monitoring for anomalous patterns that suggest data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
- **Orchestrator Configuration Changes:** Observing modifications to orchestration policies that could indicate privilege escalation attempts.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unexpected changes in network traffic volume and destinations from containers.
- Unusual container lifecycle events, such as unexpected creation or deletion of images.
- Unauthorized modification of orchestrator configurations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often utilize containers due to their ease of deployment, scalability, and ability to isolate processes. In real-world scenarios, adversaries might:
- Deploy malicious containers that bypass traditional endpoint security solutions.
- Use container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for privilege escalation or persistence.
- Exploit misconfigurations in container environments to gain unauthorized access.

Adversary emulation could involve the following activities:
- Creating a covert container with preinstalled tools for lateral movement.
- Modifying network settings within containers to facilitate command-and-control communications undetected by traditional security measures.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations and assumptions include:
- Detection relies on the presence of comprehensive logging from container platforms, which may not be enabled in all environments.
- Assumes that adversarial activities will leave detectable traces in logs or network traffic; sophisticated adversaries might use advanced obfuscation techniques.
- The strategy assumes security tools are integrated with container monitoring solutions.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment of new containers as part of normal development or operations.
- Increased network activity during peak usage times or large-scale deployments.
- Authorized changes to orchestrator configurations for maintenance or upgrades.

## Priority
The severity of this detection strategy is assessed as **High**. Justification includes the increasing reliance on containerized environments in modern IT infrastructure, which can present significant attack surfaces if not properly secured against adversarial exploitation.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are currently unavailable. However, future iterations of this strategy should include controlled adversary emulation exercises that replicate real-world tactics used by adversaries targeting containerized environments.

## Response
Upon an alert firing:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analyze logs and network traffic associated with the flagged containers.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic examination to understand the scope and impact of the incident.
4. **Remediation:** Address any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that facilitated the adversarial activity.
5. **Review and Update Policies:** Ensure security policies are updated to prevent recurrence.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently unavailable. Future updates should include curated resources for further reading on container security best practices, adversary tactics in containerized environments, and integration guides for existing security solutions with container monitoring tools.
