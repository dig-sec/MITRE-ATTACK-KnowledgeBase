# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Indicator Removal on Host using FSUtil

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to remove, alter, or obfuscate indicators that can compromise security monitoring systems. Specifically, it focuses on the use of the `fsutil` utility in Windows environments by adversaries aiming to evade detection.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages event logs and process monitoring data sources within a Windows environment. It analyzes patterns related to the usage of `fsutil`, particularly suspicious invocations that might indicate attempts to remove or modify security artifacts. The focus is on identifying anomalous behavior associated with these utilities, which are often used legitimately but can be exploited for malicious purposes.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use the `fsutil` command-line tool in Windows to perform actions like creating hidden files, manipulating file timestamps, or recovering deleted files, all of which can undermine security monitoring. These activities may indicate attempts to conceal their presence on a compromised system by removing or altering critical indicators such as logs and registry entries.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `fsutil behavior set disable8dot3namecreation 1`: Disables the creation of short (8.3) file names, potentially complicating forensic analysis.
  - `fsutil dirty query [volume]`: Queries the volume's dirty bit to determine if data has been written but not yet flushed to disk, which can be used to hide changes.

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Execute suspicious `fsutil` commands in a controlled environment and monitor logs for specific patterns.
  - Use adversary emulation tools to replicate known attack behaviors and validate detection capabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection assumes that all use of `fsutil` is logged accurately by the host system's security mechanisms, which may not always be the case due to misconfigurations or evasion techniques used by sophisticated adversaries.
- It presumes a baseline understanding of normal `fsutil` usage patterns within an organization, which might vary significantly between different environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate IT operations involving file recovery tasks using `fsutil`.
- Administrators performing maintenance or troubleshooting tasks.
- Software installations or updates that manipulate file attributes for compatibility reasons.

## Priority
**High**: This technique poses a significant risk as it can be used to systematically remove evidence of malicious activity, making detection and response more challenging. Its high priority is justified by its potential to significantly impair incident response efforts if left unchecked.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-step Instructions

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Create a test environment with Windows operating systems.
   - Ensure proper logging configurations for process creation and command-line activity.

2. **Indicator Removal using FSUtil:**
   - Execute `fsutil behavior set disable8dot3namecreation 1` to prevent the creation of short file names, making files harder to detect.
   - Run `fsutil dirty query [volume]` to check the status of data writes and potentially hide activities.

3. **Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil:**
   - Use `fsutil usn deletejournal [drive]:` followed by `fsutil volume setusnjrnl [drive]:` to reset the USN journal, erasing file metadata changes.
   - Employ `fsutil behavior set disable8dot3namecreation 0` to re-enable short name creation after testing.

4. **Monitoring and Analysis:**
   - Monitor event logs for unusual `fsutil` command usage patterns.
   - Validate detection by correlating process execution data with log entries.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. Investigate the context of the `fsutil` invocation to determine if it aligns with known benign activities or indicates malicious intent.
2. Correlate with other security events to assess the breadth of potential indicator removal attempts.
3. Preserve affected systems and logs for forensic analysis to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the adversary's actions.
