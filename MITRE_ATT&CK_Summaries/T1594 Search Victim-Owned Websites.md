# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. Specifically, it seeks to identify adversaries leveraging container technology to evade detection mechanisms typically placed on traditional operating systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activities to identify potential adversarial actions that could be indicative of an attempt to bypass security controls. Key data sources include:
- **Container Logs:** Analyze for unusual activity patterns such as unexpected process spawning or abnormal network communications.
- **Network Traffic:** Monitor for anomalous flows, especially those targeting uncommon ports or destinations.
- **Filesystem Changes:** Detect unauthorized changes within the container filesystem that could suggest persistence attempts.

The strategy leverages machine learning models trained on baseline behavior to identify deviations indicative of adversarial intent. Additionally, heuristic rules are employed to capture known attack patterns associated with container misuse.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers' isolation features and lightweight nature to evade detection by traditional security mechanisms. They may:
- Deploy malicious binaries or scripts within a container.
- Use compromised images from public repositories to introduce vulnerabilities.
- Execute commands that mimic legitimate container operations but serve malicious purposes.

**Sample Adversary Commands:**
```bash
# Pulling a potentially malicious image
docker pull adversary/malicious_image

# Running the image in detached mode
docker run -d --name compromised_container adversary/malicious_image

# Executing a script within the container to establish persistence
docker exec compromised_container /bin/sh -c 'echo "persistence_script" > /etc/init.d/startup'
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection of stealthy or zero-day exploits within containers.
  - Encrypted container communications that obfuscate malicious traffic.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Container orchestration systems are configured to provide detailed logging and monitoring capabilities.
  - Baseline behavior models are regularly updated to reflect legitimate usage patterns.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for rapid deployment and scaling operations.
- Network traffic spikes during peak business hours or due to automated testing processes.
- Scheduled maintenance scripts executing within containers that modify configurations temporarily.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly popular in modern infrastructure, offering significant advantages but also introducing new attack vectors. The ability for adversaries to use containers as a method of bypassing security monitoring poses a substantial risk, necessitating robust detection mechanisms with high priority.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:
1. **Setup Container Environment:** Deploy a controlled Docker setup.
2. **Pull Malicious Image:**
   ```bash
   docker pull adversary/malicious_image
   ```
3. **Run the Image:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name compromised_container adversary/malicious_image
   ```
4. **Execute Persistence Script:**
   ```bash
   docker exec compromised_container /bin/sh -c 'echo "persistence_script" > /etc/init.d/startup'
   ```

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
1. **Verify Alert:** Confirm the nature of detected activity to rule out false positives.
2. **Investigate Container Logs:** Examine logs for unauthorized processes or network connections.
3. **Quarantine Affected Containers:** Isolate containers exhibiting suspicious behavior to prevent lateral movement.
4. **Conduct Forensic Analysis:** Analyze container filesystem changes and memory dumps if necessary.
5. **Update Detection Models:** Refine machine learning models based on findings to improve future detection accuracy.
