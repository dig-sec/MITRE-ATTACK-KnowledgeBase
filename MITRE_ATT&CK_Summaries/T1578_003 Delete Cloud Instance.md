# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing containers within Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environments. This involves identifying efforts made by adversaries to exploit container technologies to evade detection.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1578.003 - Delete Cloud Instance
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** IaaS  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/003)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages various data sources, including logs from container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), host-level monitoring systems, and network traffic analysis tools. The patterns analyzed include unusual changes in container states or configurations, abnormal interactions with cloud instance management APIs, and unexpected deletion activities that align with defense evasion tactics.

### Data Sources:
- **Container Orchestration Logs:** To monitor lifecycle events of containers.
- **Cloud Instance Management APIs:** To detect unauthorized or suspicious API calls.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** To spot anomalies in network behavior associated with container communications.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use container technologies to evade detection by deploying malicious activities within ephemeral environments that are difficult for traditional monitoring tools to track. Common methods include:
- Deleting or terminating containers shortly after executing an attack to avoid detection.
- Using containers as a means to execute and hide command-and-control (C2) traffic.

### Adversary Emulation Details
**Sample Commands:**
- `kubectl delete pod <pod_name>` â€“ Used by adversaries to remove suspicious containers.
- API calls to terminate or modify cloud instances, e.g., via AWS CLI: `aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0`

### Test Scenarios
1. Set up a Kubernetes cluster and monitor for pod lifecycle events.
2. Simulate an adversary deleting containers shortly after execution of malicious scripts.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection might not cover all variations of container-based evasion tactics, especially those using sophisticated obfuscation techniques or zero-day vulnerabilities.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that adversaries have sufficient access to execute operations within the IaaS environment. Also assumes logging configurations are comprehensive and accurately capture relevant events.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Routine maintenance tasks involving container deletions by IT staff.
- Automated scaling actions or deployments that involve temporary containers being terminated as part of regular operation workflows.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring can significantly undermine an organization's defensive posture, allowing adversaries to conduct operations undetected. Given the increasing adoption of containerized environments in enterprise architectures, securing these platforms against evasion tactics is critical.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify Alert Context:** Determine if there were recent legitimate reasons for the detected activity (e.g., scheduled maintenance).
2. **Analyze Associated Logs:** Review logs from container orchestration systems and cloud instance management APIs to understand the scope and impact.
3. **Investigate Network Traffic:** Look for concurrent suspicious network activities that might indicate command-and-control communications or data exfiltration.
4. **Contain and Remediate:** Isolate affected environments to prevent further unauthorized actions, followed by a thorough investigation to identify and remediate any breaches.

## Additional Resources
No additional resources currently available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework documentation. Further research into container-specific security best practices is recommended for comprehensive protection strategies.
