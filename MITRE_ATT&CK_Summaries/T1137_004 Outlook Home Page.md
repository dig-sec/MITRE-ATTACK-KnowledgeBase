# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Outlook Home Page Persistence

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that leverage the Outlook Home Page feature for persistence within compromised environments.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1137.004 - Outlook Home Page
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence
- **Platforms:** Windows, Office 365

For more details, refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/004).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring changes in Outlook Home Page configurations that could be indicative of adversary manipulation. Data sources include email client logs, configuration files (e.g., `Outlook.exe.config`), and network traffic logs to detect unusual patterns such as unexpected redirections or modifications.

- **Data Sources:**
  - Email client configuration and log files
  - Network traffic analysis for Outlook-related communications

- **Patterns Analyzed:**
  - Modifications in the default home page settings of Outlook clients.
  - Unusual network requests from Outlook to external URLs.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit the Outlook Home Page feature by altering the `Outlook.exe.config` file or registry settings on Windows machines. This redirection can lead victims to phishing sites or command and control (C2) servers, maintaining persistent access within the network. 

- **Execution Method:**
  - Adversaries may use scripts or manually edit configuration files.
  - Typical commands involve modifying XML entries in `Outlook.exe.config`.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not catch alterations made by sophisticated adversaries who clean up logs post-exploitation.
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes the presence of monitoring tools that can inspect configuration files and network traffic.
  - Relies on baseline knowledge of normal behavior within the organizationâ€™s email environment.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate IT operations modifying Outlook settings for business purposes.
- Users changing their home page settings manually for convenience or personal preference.

## Priority
**Priority Level: Medium**

**Justification:** While not as immediate a threat as other persistence mechanisms, this technique can provide significant leverage for adversaries to maintain access and conduct further malicious activities. The impact is mitigated by existing network security measures but warrants attention due to its potential for stealth.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate detection capability, the following steps should be conducted in a controlled test environment:

1. **Install Outlook:**
   - Set up a Windows machine with Microsoft Outlook installed.
   
2. **Modify Home Page Configuration:**
   - Locate `Outlook.exe.config` typically found at `%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\root\OfficeXX`.
   - Edit the file to change the `<homepageUrl>` value to an internal test URL.

3. **Test Network Traffic:**
   - Use network monitoring tools to observe outbound traffic from Outlook for any requests to non-standard URLs.
   
4. **Log Review:**
   - Check if changes in configuration files are logged and if alerts trigger upon detection of these modifications.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Investigate the Source:** Identify which accounts or machines were affected by the change.
2. **Review Network Traffic:** Examine outgoing traffic to determine if there is suspicious activity linked to C2 servers.
3. **Revert Changes:** Reset Outlook Home Page configurations to their original state and monitor for further anomalies.
4. **Incident Response Plan:** Follow organizational incident response protocols, including isolation of affected systems if necessary.
