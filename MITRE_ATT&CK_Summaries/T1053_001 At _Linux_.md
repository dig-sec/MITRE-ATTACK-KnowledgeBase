# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging containers on Linux platforms.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Linux

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy revolves around monitoring and analyzing container activity on Linux environments. Key data sources include system logs (e.g., `syslog`, `auditd`), container orchestration platforms (such as Kubernetes audit logs), and process monitoring tools like `ps`, `top`, or custom scripts for container-specific metrics. Patterns of interest include unusual creation, modification, or termination of containers, unexpected changes in network configurations within containers, and processes executed with elevated privileges.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit the flexibility of containers to execute payloads that are difficult to detect using traditional security monitoring methods. They might use tools like `docker`, `podman`, or Kubernetes to deploy malicious containers, either as a persistent mechanism or to carry out privilege escalation by accessing host resources through container escape techniques.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - `docker run --privileged -d some_malicious_image`
  - `kubectl create deployment evil-deployment --image=malicious_container`
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a benign but identifiable container that mimics potential adversarial activity.
  - Execute typical privilege escalation commands from within the container.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes comprehensive logging of all container activities, which might not be feasible in high-volume environments without performance impacts.
- Detection mechanisms may not fully cover custom or non-standard container runtimes.
- Relies on predefined rules and patterns that may not capture novel adversarial techniques.

## False Positives
- Legitimate DevOps activities involving frequent creation or modification of containers for testing or development purposes might trigger alerts.
- Automated backup or maintenance scripts that utilize containers could be misinterpreted as malicious behavior.

## Priority
**High**: The capability to bypass traditional monitoring and gain elevated privileges poses a significant threat, potentially allowing adversaries unfettered access to critical systems and data.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
- None available

## Response
Upon detection of suspicious container activity:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine affected containers or nodes.
2. **Log Analysis:** Review logs for anomalous patterns or unauthorized changes.
3. **Incident Escalation:** Notify security operations teams and initiate incident response protocols.
4. **Forensic Examination:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope of any breach.

## Additional Resources
- None available

This report provides a foundational framework for detecting adversarial activities involving containers on Linux platforms, helping organizations enhance their security posture against sophisticated threats.
