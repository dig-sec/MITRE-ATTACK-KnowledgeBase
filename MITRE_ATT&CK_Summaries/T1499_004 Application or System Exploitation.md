## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources including system logs, network traffic analytics, and container orchestration platform APIs. Patterns analyzed include unusual container behaviors, such as unexpected spikes in resource usage, unauthorized access attempts to critical services, and anomalies in inter-container communications.

Key data sources:
- **Container Logs:** Monitor for abnormal operations or configuration changes.
- **Network Traffic Analytics:** Detect suspicious network patterns involving containers.
- **Orchestration Platform APIs:** Identify unauthorized API calls related to container management.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit containers by deploying malicious payloads that evade traditional security monitoring. They often use techniques such as:
- Running privileged containers without adequate isolation.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in container runtimes or orchestration tools.
- Using containers for lateral movement and persistence within the network.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- Sample Commands: Deploy a container with escalated privileges using Docker CLI (e.g., `docker run --privileged -d <image>`).
- Test Scenarios: Simulate unauthorized access attempts by configuring misconfigured firewalls or bypassing network segmentation controls.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss zero-day vulnerabilities in container runtimes.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that baseline behavior for containers is well-defined and established within the environment.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate resource spikes during peak usage times.
- Scheduled maintenance operations that involve temporary elevated access.
- Authorized configuration changes by IT staff.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly being used in modern architectures, and their exploitation can lead to significant impact on the organization’s infrastructure and data security. The potential for lateral movement and persistence amplifies the risk associated with this technique.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Set Up Test Environment:** Deploy a container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
2. **Deploy Containers:** Run multiple containers with varying configurations, ensuring some have elevated privileges.
3. **Simulate Adversarial Behavior:**
   - Execute unauthorized API calls to the orchestration platform (e.g., scale up/down resources without proper authorization).
   - Introduce network anomalies by modifying firewall rules temporarily allowing traffic from untrusted sources.
4. **Monitor Alerts:** Observe and document any alerts generated by the detection system.

## Response

When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm that the behavior is indeed anomalous and not due to a false positive.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers and network segments to prevent further spread of malicious activity.
3. **Investigation:**
   - Review logs for unauthorized access attempts or suspicious activities.
   - Assess the integrity of container images and configurations.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Patch any identified vulnerabilities in the container runtime or orchestration tools.
   - Revise security policies and access controls to prevent future occurrences.
5. **Post-Incident Analysis:** Conduct a thorough review to understand the root cause and improve detection capabilities.
