# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to escalate privileges by exploiting token impersonation or theft on Windows platforms. Specifically, it focuses on identifying unauthorized access and privilege elevation activities that bypass standard security monitoring mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1134.001 - Token Impersonation/Theft
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows

For more details, refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages various data sources including system logs (Event Logs), process monitoring tools, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems. Patterns analyzed include anomalies in token usage, unexpected privilege escalations, and unauthorized impersonation attempts.

Key data sources:
- Security Event Log (Event ID 4672 for special privileges assigned to new logon)
- Process creation events
- Token duplication activities

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Windows systems. Common methods include:

1. **Named Pipe Client Impersonation:** Attacker uses a named pipe client to impersonate another user's token.
2. **Token Duplication with `SeDebugPrivilege`:** By gaining the `SeDebugPrivilege`, attackers can duplicate tokens from higher privilege processes.
3. **Use of Exploitation Tools:**
   - **NSudo Executable:** Facilitates elevated command execution by leveraging token duplication.
   - **Juicy Potato:** A tool used to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability (MS17-010).

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection may not cover all token impersonation methods, especially novel or sophisticated techniques.
- Assumes that security monitoring tools are properly configured and integrated with system logs.
- Relies on accurate logging of user activities, which may be disabled by attackers.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks requiring elevated privileges.
- Misconfigured applications or scripts performing routine operations with elevated permissions.

## Priority
**High.** Token impersonation and theft can lead to significant unauthorized access and potential data breaches if not detected promptly. The ability of adversaries to escalate privileges undetected poses a severe risk to organizational security.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Test Environment Setup
1. **Named Pipe Client Impersonation:**
   - Use `net use` command with `/savecred` flag on Windows to impersonate another user's token.
2. **`SeDebugPrivilege` Token Duplication:**
   - Elevate a process using tools like `PsExec` or directly manipulate the security descriptor of processes to assign `SeDebugPrivilege`.
3. **Launch NSudo Executable:**
   - Execute an elevated command via NSudo, observing how it duplicates tokens.
4. **Bad Potato:**
   - Utilize BadPotato.exe to attempt privilege escalation by targeting specific vulnerabilities on Windows systems.
5. **Juicy Potato:**
   - Deploy JuicyPotato payload to exploit the MS17-010 vulnerability for token duplication.

## Response
Upon detection of this technique, analysts should:
1. Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent lateral movement.
2. Investigate the source and scope of the unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempt.
3. Review logs for additional suspicious activities indicating further exploitation attempts.
4. Update system patches and configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities.
5. Conduct a thorough security audit to identify any remaining weaknesses.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently not available. Analysts should refer to internal documentation, vendor advisories, and threat intelligence feeds for the latest information on this technique.
