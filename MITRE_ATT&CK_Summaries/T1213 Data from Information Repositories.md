# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. Adversaries may exploit container environments to hide their activities from traditional detection methods.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1213 - Data from Information Repositories
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS, SaaS, Office 365, Google Workspace, IaaS

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring container orchestration platforms and environments to identify suspicious activities. Key data sources include container logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), network traffic related to containers, and host-level activity on systems running containers. The patterns analyzed focus on anomalies in resource usage, unexpected inter-container communications, and unauthorized access attempts to repositories.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may use containers to create ephemeral environments that are difficult for traditional security tools to detect. They might execute malicious code within a container or exfiltrate data using the container's network capabilities. Techniques include:

- Running malware inside containers to avoid detection by host-based security solutions.
- Using containers to pivot between networks, exploiting their isolated nature.

### Adversary Emulation Details

Adversaries may use commands such as `docker run --rm -it malicious_image` or orchestrate complex container networks using Kubernetes manifests. Test scenarios might involve deploying containers with known vulnerabilities and monitoring for signs of exploitation attempts.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- Assumes that all containers are monitored, which may not be the case in large environments.
- Relies on comprehensive logging from container platforms; missing logs can create blind spots.
- Assumes baseline knowledge of normal container activity to detect anomalies effectively.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities include:

- Legitimate use of containers for rapid development and testing.
- Routine updates or deployments within containerized applications.
- Network communications typical in microservices architectures.

## Priority

**High**: The ability to bypass traditional monitoring with containers can lead to undetected lateral movement and data exfiltration, posing significant risks to organizational security.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Verify the Alert**: Check logs for context around the suspicious activity.
2. **Contain the Threat**: Isolate affected containers or nodes to prevent further spread.
3. **Investigate**: Determine if the activity is benign or malicious by analyzing network traffic and container behavior.
4. **Eradicate**: Remove compromised containers, update images, and apply patches.
5. **Recover**: Restore services from known good states and ensure continuous monitoring.
