# ADS Framework: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using container technologies. By leveraging containers, adversaries may attempt to mask malicious activities and evade detection mechanisms that are typically designed for traditional operating environments.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container-related activities to identify signs of misuse aimed at evading security controls. Data sources include:

- **Container Orchestration Logs:** These logs from platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or standalone containers can provide insights into deployment patterns and resource utilization.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring network traffic for unusual patterns that may indicate container-based evasion tactics.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Tracking changes in configuration files and binaries associated with container environments.

Patterns analyzed involve:

- Unusual spikes in the number of containers being deployed or terminated, especially those not aligned with normal operational profiles.
- Communication between containers on non-standard ports or to suspicious IP addresses known for command-and-control activities.
- Inconsistent file integrity alerts indicating tampering with critical container components.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit container technologies due to their lightweight nature and ability to be rapidly deployed, making them suitable for evading detection. Common tactics include:

- Using containers as a method to deploy malicious payloads in environments where traditional endpoint security tools may have limited visibility.
- Leveraging obfuscation techniques within containers to bypass signature-based defenses.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In real-world scenarios, adversaries might execute commands like:
```bash
docker run -d --name evasive_container --network host suspicious_image
```
This command runs a container with host network mode enabled, potentially allowing it to communicate directly over the network without passing through the typical network security layers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss containers that are dynamically generated or those utilizing advanced obfuscation techniques.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that baseline activity profiles for container environments are well-established, which may not be true in all organizations.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate high-frequency deployments during maintenance windows or software updates.
- Network traffic patterns associated with microservices architecture testing or development environments.
- Automated orchestration scripts running scheduled tasks without malicious intent.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

Justification: The ability of adversaries to bypass security monitoring using containers can lead to significant breaches, as these techniques allow for stealthy operations that are hard to detect and mitigate. Given the increasing adoption of containerization in enterprise environments, this technique poses a substantial risk.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no publicly available step-by-step instructions for emulating this technique in a test environment. Organizations should develop custom scenarios based on their specific infrastructure and security posture to validate detection mechanisms effectively.

## Response
When an alert related to adversarial attempts using containers is triggered:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the suspicious container instances to prevent further potential damage.
2. **Log Analysis:** Review orchestration, network, and system logs for unusual activities that correlate with the alert.
3. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation of affected systems, focusing on understanding the scope and method of exploitation.
4. **Update Security Posture:** Adjust container security policies to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and prevent future occurrences.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional references or context available beyond those provided in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Organizations should consult their internal documentation and external threat intelligence sources for further insights tailored to their specific environments.
