- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying unauthorized manipulation of access tokens within containerized environments on Windows systems. The approach leverages data from security event logs, process monitoring, and network activity to identify patterns indicative of token misuse or privilege escalation attempts.

### Data Sources:
- Security Event Logs (e.g., Windows Event Viewer)
- Process Monitoring Tools
- Network Traffic Analysis

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Unusual access token manipulations
- Unauthorized elevation of privileges within containers
- Irregular network communications from containerized processes

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute T1134 by manipulating access tokens to gain unauthorized elevated privileges, allowing them to perform actions without detection. In a Windows environment, this often involves using tools or scripts that can alter token information to bypass security controls.

### Real-world Execution:
- **Command Examples:** 
  - Use of `runas` command with `/netonly` flag to elevate network-related permissions.
  - Scripts utilizing PowerShell to manipulate tokens directly via API calls (e.g., LsaAddAccountRights).

### Adversary Emulation Details:
While specific emulation scenarios are not available, typical tests involve simulating token manipulation attempts in a controlled environment to observe system responses and log generation.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** 
  - Detection might miss sophisticated techniques that avoid leaving discernible logs.
  - Assumes comprehensive logging of relevant activities is enabled and properly configured.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The security infrastructure can capture detailed process and network activity related to container operations.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks involving token management for system maintenance or updates.
- Standard user processes requiring temporary elevated permissions within containers, such as software installations or configuration changes.

## Priority
**High** - Access Token Manipulation can lead to significant security breaches by enabling adversaries to escalate privileges undetected. This technique directly impacts the integrity and confidentiality of systems, making timely detection crucial.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific adversary emulation steps are available for this technique. Future developments may include detailed test scenarios to validate detection mechanisms in sandboxed environments.

## Response
When an alert related to access token manipulation is triggered:
1. **Verify Alert Authenticity:** Confirm that the activity is not part of scheduled maintenance or legitimate administrative tasks.
2. **Analyze Contextual Data:** Review associated logs and network traffic for additional indicators of compromise.
3. **Containment Measures:** Isolate affected containers and restrict permissions to prevent further unauthorized access.
4. **Investigate Root Cause:** Determine how token manipulation was attempted and address any underlying vulnerabilities.

## Additional Resources
- Current resources specific to this technique are not available, but practitioners are encouraged to consult broader security frameworks and community discussions for evolving best practices.
