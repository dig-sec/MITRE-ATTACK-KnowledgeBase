# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing containers on various platforms. This technique specifically targets the use of virtual instances, such as those created through container technologies or virtual machines, to evade security controls and conduct malicious activities undetected.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1564.006 - Run Virtual Instance
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy employs a combination of host-based and network data sources to identify suspicious activities related to the creation and management of virtual instances. Key data sources include system logs, process monitoring tools, container orchestration platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.

The patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual or unauthorized use of virtualization software such as VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V.
- Creation or execution of virtual machines or containers without proper authorization or documentation.
- Processes that attempt to modify system settings related to virtualization capabilities.
- Network traffic indicative of communication between the host and newly created virtual instances.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often employ virtualization technologies to create isolated environments where they can operate with impunity. These virtual environments can obscure malicious activities from traditional security controls by providing a separate execution context that may not be monitored as thoroughly as the primary system environment. Common methods include:
- Utilizing tools like `VBoxManage` for VirtualBox, or PowerShell commands for Hyper-V.
- Leveraging container orchestration platforms to spin up ephemeral containers with elevated privileges.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries may execute the following sample commands or scenarios in a real-world environment:

1. **VirtualBox:**  
   ```bash
   VBoxManage createvm --name "HiddenVM" --register
   VBoxManage startvm "HiddenVM"
   ```

2. **Hyper-V (PowerShell):**  
   ```powershell
   New-VM -Name "StealthVM" -MemoryStartupBytes 512MB -BootDevice VHD
   Start-VM -Name "StealthVM"
   ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
### Known Limitations:
- Detection may be hindered by highly customized or obfuscated virtualization software.
- Adversaries might employ sophisticated techniques to mimic legitimate processes, complicating detection.

### Assumptions:
- The environment has baseline visibility into process executions and network traffic.
- Security controls are capable of monitoring both host-level activities and container orchestration platforms.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of virtualization for development or testing environments.
- IT operations tasks involving the management or deployment of virtual machines as part of standard procedures.
- Routine updates or maintenance tasks executed by trusted administrators that involve container technologies.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to create and manage virtual instances can significantly undermine an organization's security posture. These activities enable adversaries to evade detection, maintain persistence, and conduct further malicious operations with reduced risk of discovery. Given the potential impact on data integrity and confidentiality, this technique warrants high priority in detection strategies.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Register Portable VirtualBox:**  
   Ensure that the VirtualBox software is installed and properly configured for use within your test environment.

2. **Create and Start VirtualBox Virtual Machine:**  
   ```bash
   VBoxManage createvm --name "TestVM" --register
   VBoxManage modifyvm "TestVM" --memory 1024 --cpus 1
   VBoxManage createhd --filename "~/VirtualBox VMs/TestVM/TestVM.vdi" --size 10000
   VBoxManage storagectl "TestVM" --name "SATA Controller" --add sata --controller IntelAhci
   VBoxManage storageattach "TestVM" --storagectl "SATA Controller" --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium "~/VirtualBox VMs/TestVM/TestVM.vdi"
   VBoxManage startvm "TestVM"
   ```

3. **Create and Start Hyper-V Virtual Machine:**  
   Open PowerShell with administrative privileges.
   ```powershell
   New-VM -Name "TestHyperVVM" -MemoryStartupBytes 512MB -BootDevice VHD
   Set-VMProcessor -VMName "TestHyperVVM" -Count 1
   Add-VMDvdDrive -VMName "TestHyperVVM" -Path "C:\path\to\your\iso.iso"
   Start-VM -Name "TestHyperVVM"
   ```

## Response
When an alert indicating the use of virtual instances is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Source:** Confirm whether the activity originates from a trusted user or application.
2. **Analyze Context:** Examine system logs, network traffic, and EDR alerts for additional indicators of compromise.
3. **Containment Actions:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.
   - Terminate unauthorized virtual instances.

4. **Investigate Further:** Determine if this activity is part of a broader attack campaign by reviewing related security events and system changes.
5. **Report Findings:** Document findings, including indicators and response actions, for internal review and potential escalation.
