# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection strategy is to identify and mitigate adversarial attempts that leverage containerization technologies to bypass security monitoring mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1102 - Web Service  
  This technique involves using web services as a command and control mechanism, often obfuscated within container environments.
  
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control  
  Containers can be used to obscure command and control (C2) communication channels from traditional detection systems.

- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows  
  Container technologies are cross-platform but primarily executed on Linux in enterprise environments.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) and underlying host systems for unusual activities indicative of adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Analyzing logs from Docker, Kubernetes, and other container orchestrators.
- **Network Traffic:** Monitoring outbound network traffic from containers to identify C2 communication patterns.
- **System Calls:** Observing system calls made by containers that deviate from baseline behaviors.

Patterns analyzed include unusual API calls, unexpected network connections, and anomalous resource utilization within the containerized environments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containerization technologies due to their widespread adoption in cloud-native applications. They may:

- Deploy malicious containers that communicate with external C2 servers.
- Use legitimate services as a fa√ßade for adversarial activities.
- Exploit misconfigurations to gain persistence and privilege escalation.

**Example Commands:**
- `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/sh` to access a running container shell.
- Docker commands like `docker run -d <image>` to deploy potentially malicious containers.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Emulation scenarios could include deploying benign services that mimic adversarial behaviors, such as establishing unauthorized network connections or accessing sensitive resources.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Containers leveraging ephemeral storage may leave limited forensic evidence.
  - Encrypted C2 traffic can evade detection without proper decryption capabilities.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The organization has implemented baseline monitoring for containerized environments.
  - Security teams have access to necessary tools and permissions to inspect container activities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate software updates or patches being deployed in containers.
- Routine maintenance tasks that involve network communication from containers.
- Development and testing activities involving container deployment.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
The use of containers for adversarial purposes poses a significant risk due to the potential for widespread impact across cloud-native applications. Given their ability to blend into normal operations, early detection is crucial to prevent data exfiltration or unauthorized access.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Setup a Kubernetes Cluster:**
   - Deploy a local cluster using Minikube or Kind.
   
2. **Deploy a Test Container:**
   - Use `kubectl run` to deploy a container with minimal legitimate functionality.

3. **Simulate C2 Communication:**
   - Modify the container to initiate outbound connections to an external server mimicking a C2 endpoint.

4. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Observe network traffic, logs, and system calls for deviations from expected behavior.

## Response
Guidelines for analysts when the alert fires:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected container and any related resources.
2. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if the activity is malicious.
3. **Mitigation:** Apply necessary patches or configuration changes to prevent recurrence.
4. **Reporting:** Document findings and update detection rules as needed.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework for this specific technique.
