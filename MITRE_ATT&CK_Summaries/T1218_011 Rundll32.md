# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Rundll32

## **Goal**
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts leveraging `rundll32.exe` on Windows systems to execute malicious payloads, often bypassing security monitoring measures. This technique focuses on detecting unauthorized execution of scripts or binaries using the versatile `rundll32.exe` utility.

## **Categorization**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1218.011 - Rundll32
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/011)

## **Strategy Abstract**
This strategy aims to detect suspicious activities related to `rundll32.exe` by analyzing relevant data sources including process monitoring, file integrity checks, and network traffic logs. The patterns analyzed include:
- Execution of scripts or binaries via unusual command-line arguments.
- Usage of `rundll32.exe` with uncommon DLLs or ordinals.
- Correlation between `rundll32.exe` execution and subsequent suspicious processes.

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries use `rundll32.exe`, a legitimate Windows utility, to execute arbitrary code by specifying DLL functions in the command line. This can involve:
- Executing JavaScript or VBScript payloads using `GetObject`.
- Leveraging less common DLLs such as `pcwutl.dll` for executing executables.
- Using ordinals to bypass signature-based detection mechanisms.

### **Adversary Emulation Details**
Sample commands and test scenarios include:
- `rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication" cmd /c calc`
- `rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection "setupinfo.inf",`Install.Services`,0x00010000`
- `rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupInfObjectInstallAction DefaultInstall 128 .\path_to_inf\inf_file.inf`

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- Legitimate use cases of `rundll32.exe` for system administration tasks may not be covered.
- Detection might miss variations in command syntax or advanced evasion techniques that alter execution patterns.

## **False Positives**
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts:
- Routine administrative tasks using `rundll32.exe`.
- Valid script executions in software development environments.
- Use of `rundll32.exe` for system maintenance by IT personnel.

## **Priority**
**Severity: High**

Justification: The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute payloads can lead to significant compromise, including privilege escalation and data exfiltration. Its versatility and ability to bypass certain security controls make it a high-priority threat vector.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**
To validate this detection strategy, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Rundll32 execute JavaScript Remote Payload With GetObject:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe javascript:"\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication" cmd /c calc
   ```

2. **Rundll32 execute VBscript command:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe "wscript.exe" "C:\path_to_script.vbs"
   ```

3. **Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe cscobj32.dll,_RunDLL_RunAsUser 0,"cmd /c calc",,,2
   ```

4. **Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection "setupinfo.inf",Install.Services,0x00010000
   ```

5. **Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe ieadvpack.dll,ShowHTML "https://example.com"
   ```

6. **Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupInfObjectInstallAction DefaultInstall 128 .\path_to_inf\inf_file.inf
   ```

7. **Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 132 .\path_to_inf\inf_file.inf
   ```

8. **Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler "javascript:\"\\\" \\..\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication\" cmd /c calc"
   ```

9. **Launches an executable using Rundll32 and pcwutl.dll:**
   ```bash
   rundll32.exe pcwutl.dll,_RunDLL_RunAsUser 0,"C:\path_to_exe\example.exe",,,2
   ```

10. **Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe:**
    ```bash
    rundll32.exe cscobj32.dll,SomeFunctionName "argument"
    ```

11. **Rundll32 with Ordinal Value:**
    ```bash
    rundll32.exe somefile.dll,Ordinal1234
    ```

12. **Rundll32 with Control_RunDLL:**
    ```bash
    rundll32.exe "c:\windows\control.exe",Applet "desk.cpl,@0,-4003"
    ```

13. **Rundll32 with desk.cpl:**
    ```bash
    rundll32.exe desk.cpl,ShowWindow
    ```

14. **Running DLL with .init extension and function:**
    ```bash
    rundll32.exe example.init,_FunctionName
    ```

15. **Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler:**
    ```bash
    rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler "cmd /c calc"
    ```

16. **Rundll32 execute using SetupInfObjectInstallAction with custom INF:**
    ```bash
    rundll32.exe setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 132 .\custom_inf.inf
    ```
