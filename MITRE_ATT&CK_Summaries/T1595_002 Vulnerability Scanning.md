# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms using containers. This involves detecting unauthorized and potentially harmful activities within containerized environments that adversaries might use to evade traditional security measures.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1595.002 - Vulnerability Scanning
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged, Reduced Environment)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/002)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages various data sources including container orchestration logs, network traffic data, and host system events. The patterns analyzed focus on anomalies in container behavior such as unexpected image pulls, unauthorized port access, or unusual resource usage spikes that might indicate adversarial activity.

The strategy involves:
- Monitoring for abnormal container lifecycle events.
- Analyzing network traffic originating from containers to detect exfiltration attempts.
- Inspecting file system changes within the host and containers that deviate from normal operations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to isolate malicious activities, making detection more challenging. They often exploit vulnerabilities in container images or orchestration platforms to gain persistence or privilege escalation. Common adversary techniques include:
- Pulling unauthorized container images.
- Modifying runtime configurations for privilege elevation.
- Using inter-container communication channels to hide data exfiltration.

Example adversary emulation scenarios could involve deploying a compromised image with known vulnerabilities and executing commands that mimic typical reconnaissance activities, such as scanning for open ports within the container network namespace.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may be less effective in environments where baseline behavior is not well established or where there is high legitimate use of containers.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that security controls are in place to monitor standard data sources, and that container orchestration tools provide detailed logging capabilities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate updates or patches applied through container image changes.
- Normal spikes in resource usage due to application scaling events.
- Authorized network communications for cloud-based services running within containers.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Containers are widely used in modern infrastructure, and the ability of adversaries to leverage them for evasive purposes poses a significant threat. Detecting such activities is critical to maintaining robust security postures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no specific step-by-step instructions available for adversary emulation within this context. However, typical validation might involve:
1. Deploying a compromised container image in a controlled environment.
2. Executing reconnaissance commands to simulate adversarial behavior.
3. Observing the systemâ€™s response and ensuring alerts are triggered as expected.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential adversarial activity using containers:
- Immediately isolate the affected containers from the network.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of container logs, image histories, and runtime configurations.
- Coordinate with security teams to analyze any extracted data for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Review and update security policies to prevent similar incidents.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context are available. However, organizations should refer to industry best practices and maintain awareness of emerging threats related to containerized environments.
