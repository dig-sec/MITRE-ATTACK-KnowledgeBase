# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Process Doppelgänging

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging the Windows process doppelgänging method, a sophisticated form of evasion that allows malware to execute malicious code under the guise of legitimate processes.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy involves monitoring the behavior of processes in a Windows environment to identify instances where legitimate executable files are being manipulated to conceal malicious code. The primary data sources include system event logs, file integrity checks, and process monitoring tools.

The key patterns analyzed involve:
- Unexpected or unauthorized modifications to legitimate executable files.
- Creation of memory-resident malware that mimics the signatures of known good processes.
- Use of Windows APIs such as `CreateProcessWithTokenW` in combination with specific flags like `CREATE_SUSPENDED`.

## Technical Context
Adversaries utilize process doppelgänging to hide malicious payloads by abusing Windows File System and Process Management features. The technique involves creating a suspended copy of a legitimate executable file, which is then partially overwritten with malicious code, while retaining the original file's metadata.

### Execution Details
- **Manipulation of Executables:** Adversaries modify only specific portions of an executable’s memory image to execute malicious code.
- **API Usage:** Commonly used APIs include `NtCreateFile`, `NtWriteVirtualMemory`, and `Process Hollowing` techniques with a focus on `CREATE_SUSPENDED`.

### Example Commands
```shell
# Example usage might involve:
CreateProcessWithTokenW(NULL, CREATE_SUSPENDED | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION, "legitimate.exe", NULL, ...
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** Detection assumes that the baseline of legitimate process behavior is well-understood.
- **Blind Spot:** New or highly sophisticated evasion techniques might not be immediately detectable if they deviate significantly from known patterns.

## False Positives
- Legitimate software development activities involving debugging tools and memory manipulation can generate similar patterns, leading to potential false positives. 
- System updates or patches that temporarily modify executable files could also trigger alerts erroneously.

## Priority
**High**  
Justification: Process doppelgänging is a critical evasion technique used in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios. Its ability to bypass traditional security measures makes it imperative to detect and respond promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
*None available*

Due to the complexity and potential risks involved, adversary emulation of this technique should be conducted under controlled conditions by experienced cybersecurity professionals with appropriate legal permissions.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.
2. **Incident Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to confirm whether process doppelgänging has occurred, examining suspicious processes and associated file modifications.
3. **Forensic Collection:** Gather relevant logs and memory dumps for forensic analysis to understand the scope and nature of the attack.
4. **Mitigation Measures:** Apply patches or configuration changes to prevent recurrence, such as disabling unnecessary Windows APIs used by attackers.
