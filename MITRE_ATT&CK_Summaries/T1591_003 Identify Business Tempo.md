# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technology. Attackers may use containers to obfuscate malicious activities, making it difficult for traditional detection methods to identify and respond to threats.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous container activities that may indicate an attempt to bypass security monitoring. Key data sources include container orchestration logs, network traffic, and system-level events. Patterns analyzed involve unusual container creation rates, unexpected changes in container configurations, and abnormal inter-container communications.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit containers by running malicious workloads or scripts within isolated environments that are not adequately monitored. They might use lightweight, ephemeral containers to execute commands quickly and dispose of them before detection. Adversaries often employ techniques such as:

- **Container Spraying:** Creating numerous containers rapidly to overwhelm monitoring systems.
- **Misconfigured Network Policies:** Allowing malicious traffic to bypass security controls.
- **Resource Limits Manipulation:** Exploiting resource allocation settings to maximize the impact of attacks.

### Sample Commands/Test Scenarios

1. **Container Spraying:**
   ```bash
   for i in {1..100}; do docker run -d --name container$i my-malicious-image; done
   ```

2. **Network Policy Misconfiguration Test:**
   Configure a Docker network with permissive rules and test inter-container communications.

3. **Resource Limits Manipulation:**
   ```bash
   docker run --cpus="4" --memory="8g" my-malicious-image
   ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Assumption:** Security monitoring tools are capable of accessing detailed container logs.
- **Blind Spot:** Highly sophisticated adversaries may employ advanced evasion techniques that mimic legitimate activities.
- **Gaps:** Detection strategies might not cover custom-built or proprietary container environments.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate high-frequency deployments during development sprints.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks that involve temporary container creation.
- Misconfigurations in CI/CD pipelines leading to unexpected container behavior.

## Priority

**Priority Level: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used for both legitimate applications and malicious activities. The ability of adversaries to bypass security controls using containers poses a significant threat, especially in environments with extensive container usage.

## Response

When an alert indicating potential adversarial use of containers is triggered:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm the legitimacy of the activity by cross-referencing logs and network traffic.
2. **Contain the Threat:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Investigate Root Cause:** Analyze container configurations, deployment scripts, and access logs for indicators of compromise.
4. **Remediate:** Address any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in container settings and network policies.
5. **Enhance Monitoring:** Adjust detection rules to reduce false positives and improve accuracy.
