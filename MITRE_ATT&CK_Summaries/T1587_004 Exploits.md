# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves identifying when attackers are leveraging container technologies to evade detection by traditional security measures.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activity to identify suspicious behavior indicative of attempts to bypass security controls. Key data sources include container orchestration logs, network traffic associated with containers, and system-level events related to container lifecycle management. Patterns analyzed involve unusual access patterns, anomalous resource consumption, and deviations from baseline behaviors typical of legitimate container operations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to evade detection by exploiting their ephemeral nature and the complexity they introduce into an environment. Common tactics include:
- **Container Spraying:** Deploying numerous containers rapidly to overwhelm defenses.
- **Resource Hiding:** Using containers to conceal malicious processes or data.
- **Network Isolation:** Leveraging container networks to avoid detection by external monitoring tools.

In practice, adversaries might execute these techniques using commands like `docker run` with specific flags to alter network settings or resource limits. Test scenarios could involve deploying benign containers with similar configurations to observe system responses and refine detection rules.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Dynamic Environments:** Rapid changes in container environments may lead to overlooked indicators.
- **Legitimate Use Cases:** High variability in legitimate container use can obscure malicious patterns.
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited visibility into nested or heavily obfuscated containers.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate high-frequency deployments during development cycles.
- Standard operations involving resource-intensive applications within containers.
- Routine updates and maintenance activities that alter container configurations.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the use of containers for evasion is not exceedingly common, its potential impact on security monitoring capabilities warrants attention. The balance between operational flexibility and security oversight makes this a significant concern.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify the legitimacy of container activities by cross-referencing with known development schedules or operational changes.
2. **Containment:** Isolate suspicious containers to prevent further potential exploitation.
3. **Analysis:** Examine logs and network traffic for indicators of compromise (IoCs) or unusual patterns.
4. **Notification:** Inform relevant stakeholders, including security teams and affected business units.
