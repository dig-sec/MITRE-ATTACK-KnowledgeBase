# Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. Specifically, it focuses on identifying when adversaries modify cloud compute infrastructure to evade detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy utilizes cloud infrastructure logs and container orchestration platform metrics to identify suspicious modifications indicative of attempts to bypass security monitoring. The key data sources include:

- Cloud provider audit logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs)
- Container runtime logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Network traffic logs

The patterns analyzed focus on unusual changes in container configurations or unexpected modifications to compute resources that could suggest attempts at evasion.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by altering the configuration of cloud instances or containers to remove monitoring agents, change network policies, or obscure their activities. This can involve:

- Modifying container images to disable logging features.
- Changing instance metadata to prevent security agent installation.
- Altering Kubernetes configurations to bypass Network Policies.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Sample commands for emulation might include:

- Using `kubectl` to modify pod security settings to disable logs:
  ```bash
  kubectl patch deployment <deployment-name> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"admission.cloud.google.com/allow-unqualified-execute-user":"*"}}}}}'
  ```
- Modifying instance metadata (AWS example) via CLI to remove monitoring endpoints.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** Monitoring agents are consistently deployed across all compute resources.
- **Limitations:** This strategy may not detect sophisticated evasion techniques that mimic legitimate configuration changes.
- **Gaps:** Limited visibility into encrypted container traffic or obfuscated metadata changes can hinder detection.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate updates to configurations by administrators for scaling purposes.
- Routine modifications during infrastructure maintenance or upgrades.
- Deployment of new features within containers that temporarily disable logging.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The ability for adversaries to modify cloud compute infrastructure to evade detection poses a significant threat. It can allow undetected malicious activities, including data exfiltration and persistent access establishment.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. Verify the authenticity of configuration changes by cross-referencing with known administrative actions.
2. Assess the scope of affected resources and determine if monitoring capabilities have been compromised.
3. Re-enable logging and monitoring where feasible to regain visibility into activities.
4. Conduct a thorough investigation to identify potential adversarial involvement.
