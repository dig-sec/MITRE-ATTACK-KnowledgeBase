# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. By leveraging container technology, adversaries can obscure their activities from traditional detection mechanisms and maintain persistence within a network.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring container activities on both Windows and Office 365 platforms. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR) feeds
- Network traffic analysis
- Security information and event management (SIEM) systems

Patterns analyzed include unusual spikes in container deployments, abnormal network traffic originating from containers, and suspicious modifications to container configurations. Alerts are generated when these patterns exceed predefined thresholds or exhibit anomalous behavior.

## Technical Context

Adversaries use containers to bypass security controls by encapsulating malicious activities within isolated environments that traditional monitoring tools might not inspect deeply. They may execute containerized applications with elevated privileges, leverage container orchestration platforms for lateral movement, and modify configurations to evade detection.

### Adversary Emulation Details

In a real-world scenario, an adversary might use commands like:

- `docker run -d --privileged <malicious_image>`
- `kubectl apply -f <suspicious_deployment.yaml>`

Test scenarios include deploying benign containers with suspicious characteristics and monitoring how they interact with the network and host systems.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection might miss container activities if logs are not properly configured or aggregated.
  - Encrypted traffic within containers may evade pattern recognition.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Security tools have full visibility into container orchestration platforms.
  - Baseline behavior is well-defined to distinguish between normal and suspicious activity.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate deployments of new microservices or applications using containers.
- Scheduled updates or maintenance tasks involving containerized components.
- Network testing or penetration testing activities conducted by internal teams.

## Priority
**High**

Justification: The use of containers for evasion poses a significant risk due to their ability to obscure malicious activities from traditional security controls. Early detection is crucial to prevent adversaries from establishing persistence and executing further attacks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, there are no detailed step-by-step instructions available for adversary emulation specific to this technique. Future efforts should focus on developing comprehensive test scenarios that mimic adversarial behavior in a controlled environment.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected container and associated network segments.
2. **Investigation:** Analyze logs, configurations, and network traffic related to the suspicious activity.
3. **Collaboration:** Engage with security teams to correlate findings with other potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
4. **Remediation:** Remove malicious containers, patch vulnerabilities, and update monitoring rules as necessary.

## Additional Resources

Currently, there are no additional resources available specific to this detection strategy. Future updates will include links to relevant research papers, case studies, or tool recommendations that can enhance the effectiveness of this approach.
