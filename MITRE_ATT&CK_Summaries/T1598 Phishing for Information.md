# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Phishing for Information

## Goal

The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to gather sensitive information through phishing activities aimed at compromising users and systems.

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages multiple data sources, including email logs, web traffic records, and user behavior analytics to identify patterns indicative of phishing attempts. Key indicators include suspicious links in emails, anomalies in login behaviors, and unusual data access patterns.

**Data Sources:**
- Email logs
- Web traffic records
- User activity monitoring

**Patterns Analyzed:**
- Sudden increase in outbound email containing specific keywords or domains.
- Anomalous web traffic from user accounts accessing known phishing sites.
- Unusual login attempts followed by atypical data access patterns.

---

## Technical Context

Phishing for Information involves adversaries sending deceptive emails to trick users into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details. These emails often contain malicious links or attachments that lead the victim to spoofed websites designed to capture user inputs.

### Adversary Emulation Details:

**Common Commands and Scenarios:**
- Use of PowerShell scripts embedded in emails for credential harvesting.
- Setting up fake corporate sites mimicking legitimate URLs to deceive users.

**Real-World Execution:**
Adversaries often send spear-phishing emails tailored to specific individuals or organizations, leveraging social engineering techniques to increase the likelihood of success. The emails may contain urgent language or requests for immediate action to prompt hasty responses from victims.

---

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

### Known Limitations:
- Detection relies heavily on the presence of known phishing indicators; zero-day tactics might evade detection.
- False negatives can occur if attackers use highly sophisticated methods that mimic legitimate user behavior closely.

### Assumptions:
- User behavior patterns are consistent enough to detect anomalies effectively.
- Email filtering systems have already reduced the volume of phishing emails reaching end-users.

---

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate marketing campaigns with high email volumes containing similar keywords or links.
- Authorized IT operations involving domain changes or temporary website setups for maintenance.
- Users accessing new, legitimate websites for research or work purposes.

---

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: Phishing attacks pose a significant threat as they can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems. The potential impact of compromised credentials or confidential information justifies the high priority assigned to detecting these activities promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Configure email server logs for monitoring.
   - Simulate user accounts and activity monitoring systems.
   
2. **Create Phishing Emails:**
   - Design emails with embedded links leading to controlled, mock phishing sites.
   - Use PowerShell scripts within attachments as bait.

3. **Execute Test Scenarios:**
   - Send phishing emails to test users and monitor responses.
   - Track web traffic for access attempts to the mock phishing domains.

4. **Analyze Detection Efficacy:**
   - Verify if email logs, web traffic records, and user behavior analytics identify the simulated phishing attempt.

*Note:* No specific adversary emulation steps are currently available beyond this framework outline.

## Response

Guidelines for analysts when the alert fires:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems or accounts to prevent further data exfiltration.
   - Temporarily disable compromised user credentials.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review email logs, web traffic, and user behavior reports to understand the scope of the attack.
   - Identify the source and nature of the phishing attempt.

3. **Notification:**
   - Inform affected users about the phishing incident and provide guidance on changing passwords and verifying account activities.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Implement necessary security patches or updates to prevent similar future attempts.
   - Enhance email filtering rules based on observed patterns from the attack.

5. **Documentation & Reporting:**
   - Document findings, response actions, and lessons learned for organizational reference and compliance requirements.
