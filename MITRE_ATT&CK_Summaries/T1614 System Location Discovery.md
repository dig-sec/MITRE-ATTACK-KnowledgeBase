# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containerization technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and other container management tools. The focus is on detecting activities that indicate an adversary's intent to obscure their operations or movements within a network environment.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages a multi-source approach to monitor for signs of container misuse aimed at evading traditional security mechanisms. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Monitoring logs from Docker and Kubernetes for suspicious activities such as unexpected image pulls, deployments, or orchestration events.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Observing anomalous network traffic patterns that might indicate containers are being used to tunnel or redirect traffic.
- **System Calls/Process Monitoring:** Detecting unusual system calls or processes indicative of container manipulation.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Frequent creation and deletion of containers
- Unusual network communication from containers
- Execution of commands intended for location discovery (e.g., IP lookup tools)

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit containers due to their ability to isolate processes, making it challenging to track malicious activities. In real-world scenarios, adversaries might:

- Use containers to execute lateral movement within a network by evading traditional endpoint detection.
- Run command and control servers inside containers to mask their presence.
- Leverage IP spoofing or obfuscation techniques through container networks.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

To emulate this technique, adversaries might use commands such as:

- **Windows:** `curl ipinfo.io`
- **Linux/macOS:** `curl ipinfo.io`

These commands can be executed within containers to gather geolocation information, indicating potential reconnaissance activities by adversaries.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss stealthy container-based evasion tactics that mimic benign traffic.
  - Advanced obfuscation techniques might still go undetected if they closely resemble legitimate network or application behavior.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Containers are assumed to be deployed in a monitored environment where logging and telemetry can capture relevant data.
  - The presence of baseline behavior for containers is necessary to identify anomalies effectively.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers for testing or development purposes.
- Routine network diagnostics using tools like `curl` from within a container.
- Automated deployment and scaling operations in cloud environments.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification:
- Containers are widely adopted in modern infrastructure, providing adversaries with numerous opportunities to exploit them.
- Successful exploitation can lead to significant breaches, as containers often run critical applications or services.
- The dynamic nature of containerized environments complicates traditional security monitoring, increasing the risk of undetected activities.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Set Up a Test Environment:**
   - Deploy Docker on Windows and Linux-based systems for testing purposes.

2. **Windows Environment:**
   - Pull an image with `curl` installed or use a base image like `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore`.
   - Run the container:
     ```bash
     docker run -it mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest ipinfo.io"
     ```
   - Monitor logs for any network activity indicating IP lookup.

3. **Linux/macOS Environment:**
   - Pull a base image like `alpine` or an existing one with `curl`:
     ```bash
     docker pull alpine
     docker run --rm alpine curl ipinfo.io
     ```
   - Observe container logs and network traffic for anomalies.

## Response

When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Investigate the Source:**
   - Identify the origin of suspicious activities within the containers.
   - Assess whether similar patterns are observed across other parts of the environment.

2. **Analyze Network Traffic:**
   - Trace any unusual network communications back to their source and destination.

3. **Inspect Container Configurations:**
   - Review container configurations for unauthorized changes or unexpected deployments.

4. **Coordinate with Security Teams:**
   - Share findings with incident response teams to determine if broader security measures need to be enacted.
