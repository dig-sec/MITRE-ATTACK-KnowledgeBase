# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Regsvcs/Regasm

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using `regsvcs` and `regasm`, which are tools associated with registering COM components in Windows environments.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring system calls and file activities associated with `regsvcs` and `regasm`. By analyzing event logs, process executions, and network traffic for these commands, the strategy aims to identify unauthorized or suspicious use indicative of an evasion attempt.

### Data Sources:
- Windows Event Logs (e.g., Security, Application)
- Process Monitoring Tools
- File Integrity Checks

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Execution of `regsvcs`/`regasm` from unusual locations or processes
- Sudden spikes in usage patterns inconsistent with normal operations
- Changes to system files that correlate with these tools' activities

## Technical Context
Adversaries leverage `regsvcs` and `regasm` to manipulate COM registration, potentially hiding malicious components within legitimate ones. These commands can be used to execute arbitrary code or alter application behaviors without raising immediate alerts.

### Real-world Execution:
Adversaries may download scripts that employ these tools to modify system configurations or deploy malware discreetly. By executing from command line interfaces or embedding in scripts, attackers aim to evade detection mechanisms focused on more overt activities.

#### Sample Commands:
```shell
regasm.exe -codebase MaliciousComponent.dll /tlb:Malicious.tlb
regsvcs.exe MaliciousComponent.dll /u
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all instances of `regsvcs`/`regasm` are logged appropriately.
- Relies on the assumption that legitimate uses of these tools do not mimic adversarial behavior patterns.
- May not detect evasion if adversaries use additional obfuscation techniques.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate software installations or updates that require COM registration.
- System maintenance scripts using `regsvcs`/`regasm`.

Careful tuning and contextual analysis are necessary to distinguish between malicious and legitimate uses.

## Priority
**High:** The technique directly impacts the ability of adversaries to bypass security monitoring, making it crucial to detect and mitigate swiftly. Given its use in sophisticated attack scenarios, prompt detection is essential.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a controlled test environment:

### Regasm Uninstall Method Call Test
1. **Preparation:** Ensure you have administrative privileges on the Windows machine.
2. **Execute:**
   ```shell
   regasm.exe -u MaliciousComponent.dll
   ```
3. **Observation:** Monitor for any unusual process activity or changes in system files.

### Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test
1. **Preparation:** Set up a test environment with appropriate logging enabled.
2. **Execute:**
   ```shell
   regsvcs.exe MaliciousComponent.dll /u
   ```
3. **Observation:** Look for security alerts or log entries indicating the invocation of `regsvcs`.

## Response
When an alert triggers:
1. **Verify Context:** Determine if there are legitimate reasons for the execution.
2. **Analyze Logs:** Review associated logs to assess the scope and impact.
3. **Containment:** If malicious, isolate affected systems from the network.
4. **Remediation:** Remove any unauthorized COM registrations or files.
5. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the source of the activity.
