# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that aim to bypass security monitoring systems by utilizing container technologies. This involves detecting when adversaries leverage containers to obscure their activities and evade detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring various data sources that provide insights into container activities and network traffic. Key patterns analyzed include abnormal container behaviors, unusual network communication from containers, and discrepancies in physical location data. Data sources leveraged may include:
- Container orchestrator logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- Network flow data
- System process logs

The strategy aims to detect anomalies that suggest attempts to obscure true activities or locations using containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to bypass security monitoring because they provide an isolated environment where processes can run without being easily detected by traditional endpoint defenses. Adversarial execution typically involves:
1. Deploying containers with specific configurations to exploit gaps in network policies.
2. Utilizing privileged access to modify container images or runtime environments, thus avoiding detection.

### Adversary Emulation
Adversaries might execute the following commands to test security controls and bypass detection:
- `docker run --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE -v /:/mnt/host alpine sh`
- `kubectl exec <pod-name> -- privileged=true -- sh`

These commands allow adversaries to gain elevated privileges within containers, facilitating their evasion tactics.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Containers with legitimate yet complex configurations may not be accurately flagged.
  - Dynamic scaling features of container orchestrators can complicate monitoring efforts.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Security controls are consistently applied across all containers.
  - Network policies are effectively enforced to prevent unauthorized access.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of privileged containers for maintenance tasks or debugging.
- Authorized system administrators using `docker` or `kubectl` commands with elevated privileges as part of their duties.

## Priority
**High**

The priority is assessed as high due to the significant threat posed by adversaries successfully evading detection mechanisms. Containers can provide a powerful means of hiding malicious activities, making it crucial for organizations to detect and mitigate these threats effectively.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Set Up Test Environment:** Configure a Kubernetes cluster with monitoring enabled.
2. **Deploy Privileged Container:**
   - Execute the command `kubectl run test-pod --image=alpine --restart=Never --privileged=true`.
3. **Simulate Anomalous Activity:**
   - Within the container, attempt to access host system files or perform network scans using privileged commands.
4. **Monitor Alerts:** Check if the monitoring systems flag these activities as suspicious.

*Note:* Specific adversary emulation steps may vary based on the organization's infrastructure and security controls.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Verify Alert:** Confirm that the activity originates from a legitimate source or requires further investigation.
2. **Contain Threat:** If malicious, isolate affected containers to prevent lateral movement within the network.
3. **Investigate Activity:** Determine the extent of unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration.
4. **Mitigate Risk:** Apply necessary patches or policy changes to prevent recurrence.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available. However, organizations should stay informed on best practices for container security through official documentation from Kubernetes, Docker, and other relevant platforms.
