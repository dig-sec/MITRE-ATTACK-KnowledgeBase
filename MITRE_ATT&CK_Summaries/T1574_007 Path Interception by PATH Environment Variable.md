# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using PATH Environment Variable Manipulation

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by manipulating the `PATH` environment variable on Windows systems, facilitating persistence and privilege escalation.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring changes to the `PATH` environment variable on Windows systems. Key data sources include:

- **Event Logs:** Analyze logs for changes in user or system-level environment variables.
- **Sysmon Logs:** Monitor and alert on modifications to registry keys associated with the `PATH` (e.g., `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment`).
- **Process Monitoring:** Detect suspicious processes that are executed from unusual paths not typically included in standard system directories.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual or unauthorized changes to the `PATH` variable.
- Execution of binaries from non-standard directories indicated by modified `PATH`.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may manipulate the `PATH` environment variable to execute malicious binaries before legitimate versions, aiding persistence and privilege escalation. They might add their own directories to the front of the `PATH`, causing the system to prioritize their executables over authentic ones.

### Real-World Execution:
- **Registry Modification:** Attackers modify Windows registry keys related to environment variables.
- **Command Injection:** Use scripts or command-line instructions like `setx PATH "C:\malicious;%PATH%"` to alter the `PATH`.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:
- Detection may miss changes made through scripts that temporarily modify the environment for a single session.
- Users with administrative privileges can legitimately change the `PATH`, making it challenging to distinguish malicious intent.

Assumptions:
- The system logs are comprehensive and intact, capturing all relevant environmental variable modifications.
- Baseline knowledge of typical `PATH` configurations is established.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate software installations or updates that temporarily modify the `PATH`.
- Developer environments where custom directories are frequently added to the `PATH`.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
Justification: Manipulating the `PATH` variable can significantly undermine system security, enabling persistent access and evading detection mechanisms.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Verify Changes:** Confirm that modifications were not part of a planned update or installation.
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine if any unauthorized processes were executed due to changes in the `PATH`.
3. **Revert Modifications:** Restore the `PATH` to its known good state.
4. **Investigate User Activity:** Review user accounts involved in making changes for potential compromise.
