# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Boot or Logon Autostart Execution

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing techniques that execute malicious code at boot or logon. This includes detecting the use of autostart mechanisms to maintain persistence and facilitate privilege escalation.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1547 - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages multiple data sources to identify patterns indicative of boot or logon autostart execution. Key data sources include:
- **System Logs**: To monitor startup programs and services.
- **Event Logs**: For Windows systems, focusing on Event ID 7045 (a new process has requested privileges).
- **Process Monitoring Tools**: Observing unexpected processes at system startup.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Anomalies in registry keys or scheduled tasks that are not consistent with normal user behavior.
- Unexpected modifications to autostart directories and services.
- Execution of suspicious binaries during boot or logon phases.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use this technique by embedding malicious code into system startup processes, enabling them to persist across reboots and evade detection. Common methods include:
- Modifying registry keys on Windows (e.g., `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`).
- Using cron jobs or launch agents on Unix-based systems.
- Injecting scripts in startup folders.

Adversaries may also use tools like PsExec, WMI, or remote management software to execute these modifications remotely. This strategy focuses on identifying both direct and indirect signs of such modifications.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots**: 
  - Detection might miss sophisticated techniques that do not leave obvious traces in system logs.
  - Encrypted payloads could evade signature-based detection mechanisms.
  
- **Assumptions**:
  - The baseline behavior is well-defined, allowing for the identification of deviations.
  - Log retention policies are adequate to provide sufficient historical data for analysis.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software installations or updates that modify startup settings.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks configured by IT administrators.
- User-installed applications that automatically run at boot.

## Priority
**Priority: High**
Justification: Boot and logon autostart execution techniques are critical for adversaries to maintain persistence, making them a significant threat. Early detection is essential to prevent privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Add a Driver**:
   - Create or obtain a benign driver for testing purposes.
   
2. **Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe**:
   - Execute `pnputil.exe add-driver <driver.inf> /install` to install the driver.
   - Monitor Event ID 7045 in Windows event logs to detect this activity.

3. **Leverage Virtual Channels to execute custom DLL during successful RDP session**:
   - Set up an RDP session and use a tool like Remote Desktop Gateway with a virtual channel extension to load a benign DLL.
   - Observe the system's process monitoring tools for unexpected DLL loads during the session startup.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
- Verify if the identified autostart entry correlates with known legitimate applications or scheduled tasks.
- Investigate the origin and purpose of any suspicious entries in the registry or task scheduler.
- Isolate affected systems to prevent potential lateral movement by the adversary.
- Collect forensic data for further analysis and incident response activities.
