# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Registry Queries

## Goal
The primary goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems through the use of registry queries on Windows platforms. This involves identifying and analyzing unauthorized or suspicious interactions with the Windows registry, which could indicate an adversary's attempt to gather sensitive information or modify system settings without detection.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1012 - Query Registry
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing registry query activities to identify potential security threats. Data sources include system logs, event logs, PowerShell history, and network traffic data. Patterns analyzed involve unusual or unauthorized registry queries, excessive querying of sensitive keys, and the use of scripts or tools known for malicious purposes. The strategy also includes identifying patterns that deviate from normal user behavior or baseline activities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often query the Windows registry to gather information about installed software, system configurations, or active network connections. This technique can be executed using native commands like `reg.exe` or through PowerShell cmdlets such as `Get-ItemProperty`. In real-world scenarios, adversaries may use these queries to locate security-related keys, check for specific software installations, or determine the presence of monitoring tools.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `reg query HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion`
  - PowerShell cmdlets like `Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion'`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Encrypted or obfuscated registry queries that bypass detection.
  - Registry queries conducted through less common APIs or frameworks not covered by standard monitoring tools.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The baseline of normal registry query activity is well-defined and understood.
  - Monitoring tools have sufficient access to capture all relevant registry interactions.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software installation or updates querying the registry.
- System maintenance scripts performing routine checks on registry settings.
- Administrative tasks involving registry modifications for system configuration.

## Priority
**High**: Given the critical nature of the Windows registry in storing sensitive configuration and security-related information, unauthorized access or modification poses a significant threat to system integrity and confidentiality. Detecting such activities promptly is crucial to prevent potential exploitation by adversaries.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Query Registry**: Use `reg query HKLM\Software\Microsoft` to inspect installed software details.
2. **Query Registry with PowerShell cmdlets**: Execute `Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion'`.
3. **Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with PowerShell**: Run `Get-ChildItem -Path 'HKCR:'`.
4. **Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status**: Use `reg query HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated`.
5. **Check Software Inventory Logging (SIL) status via Registry**: Query `reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Sil` to determine SIL configuration.
6. **Inspect SystemStartOptions Value in Registry**: Execute `reg query HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager`.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Source**: Confirm whether the registry queries originated from legitimate sources or unauthorized access points.
2. **Assess Context**: Evaluate the context and frequency of the queries to determine if they align with normal operational activities.
3. **Containment Measures**: If malicious intent is suspected, isolate affected systems to prevent further data exfiltration or system compromise.
4. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify potential vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries and gather evidence for forensic analysis.
