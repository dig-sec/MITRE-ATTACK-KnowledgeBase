# Detection Strategy Report: Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This includes identifying when adversaries leverage container technology to obscure their activities, evade detection systems, or execute malicious code within a seemingly benign environment.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1589 - Gather Victim Identity Information
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Access)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container activity and analyzing patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Network traffic associated with containerized applications
- Host-level system calls and process monitoring

Patterns analyzed include unusual resource consumption by containers, unexpected network connections, and anomalies in the deployment or runtime configuration of containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit container environments to bypass traditional security measures. They might:
- Execute malicious code within a container to hide their activities.
- Use containers to obfuscate command and control (C2) traffic.
- Exploit misconfigurations in container orchestration platforms to gain elevated privileges or access sensitive data.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In a controlled test environment, adversaries might:
- Deploy malicious containers using compromised credentials.
- Modify container images to include backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
- Use tools like `kubectl` with elevated permissions to manipulate running containers.

Sample commands for emulation:
```bash
# Deploy a malicious container
docker run -d --name malicious_container -p 8080:80 vulnerable_image

# Gain unauthorized access via misconfigured kubeconfig
kubectl exec -it malicious_pod -- /bin/bash
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss zero-day vulnerabilities in container runtimes.
  - Highly sophisticated adversaries might use encryption or other obfuscation techniques to evade detection.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has comprehensive logging enabled for containers and network traffic.
  - Security teams have baseline knowledge of normal container behavior.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate high resource usage by development or testing containers.
- Network spikes during routine updates or deployments.
- Misconfigurations in logging tools leading to incomplete data capture.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The use of containers is widespread across industries, and adversaries can leverage them to bypass traditional security measures. The ability to detect such attempts is critical for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive systems.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Assess the container's configuration, network connections, and resource usage.
2. **Containment:** Isolate suspicious containers from the network and other resources.
3. **Eradication:** Remove malicious code or configurations from affected containers.
4. **Recovery:** Restore services using verified clean images and configurations.
5. **Post-Incident Analysis:** Review logs and events to understand the attack vector and improve defenses.
