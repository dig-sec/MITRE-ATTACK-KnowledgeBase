## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on identifying unauthorized modifications to PowerShell profiles, which adversaries commonly use to execute malicious scripts upon user login. The approach leverages various data sources including:

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** To detect changes in the PowerShell profile files (`profile.ps1`, `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`).
- **Audit Logs:** Analyzing Windows Event logs for suspicious modifications and execution patterns.
- **Process Monitors:** Tracking processes initiated by modified PowerShell profiles to identify unexpected or unauthorized scripts.

The strategy examines file change timestamps, user contexts under which changes were made, and the nature of executed commands. Anomalous behavior such as executing scripts from non-standard directories, usage of certain cmdlets like `Start-Process`, or execution originating outside normal business hours is scrutinized.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often modify PowerShell profiles to achieve persistence by injecting malicious scripts that run every time a user logs in with PowerShell. This can be particularly effective on systems where PowerShell is frequently used for administrative tasks, as it allows attackers to maintain their foothold without needing to log into the system physically.

### Execution Scenarios:

1. **Profile Modification:** Adversaries may inject or replace content within existing profile scripts.
2. **New Profile Creation:** Malicious profiles are created with harmful commands embedded.
3. **Script Download and Execution:** Profiles are modified to download and execute additional payloads from remote servers.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

- **Sample Command:**
  ```powershell
  $content = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllText("$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1")
  if (-not $content -match "Invoke-MaliciousActivity") {
      $newContent = "$content`nInvoke-MaliciousActivity"
      [System.IO.File]::WriteAllText("$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1", $newContent)
  }
  ```

### Test Scenario:
In a controlled environment, an analyst can emulate this technique by appending malicious commands to the PowerShell profile and triggering execution through manual login or scheduled tasks.

---

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spot:** Detection may not cover scenarios where adversaries use encrypted scripts or obfuscation techniques that are less recognizable.
- **Assumption:** The detection assumes changes in PowerShell profiles are inherently suspicious. Legitimate automated updates or configurations might trigger alerts.
- **Limitations:** File integrity systems must be properly configured and synchronized across monitored environments to ensure accurate change detection.

---

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false positives include:

- **Legitimate Script Updates:** Administrators updating profile scripts for efficiency improvements.
- **Software Deployment Scripts:** Automated tools or management solutions that modify user profiles as part of deployment processes.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations:** Different organizational units might have unique PowerShell configurations considered standard within their context.

---

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification:
The modification of PowerShell profiles poses a significant risk due to its potential for persistent and covert execution of malicious activities. This technique can lead to prolonged unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network.

---

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Access:** Gain administrative privileges on a test Windows machine.
2. **Navigate to Profile Directory:**
   ```powershell
   cd $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\
   ```
3. **Modify Profile:**
   - Append a benign script or command:
     ```powershell
     echo "Write-Host 'Test Alert'" >> Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
     ```

4. **Trigger Execution:** Log in with PowerShell to observe the execution of the appended line.

5. **Revert Changes:** Remove or comment out the injected lines post-validation.
   ```powershell
   # Write-Host "Test Alert"
   ```

## Response

When an alert triggers due to suspicious changes to a PowerShell profile:

1. **Immediate Verification:** Confirm if the change is part of scheduled maintenance or authorized updates.
2. **Investigate Context:**
   - Check user account activity and timing.
   - Review associated processes for unauthorized access or execution patterns.
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent lateral movement or data leakage.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Restore profiles from known good backups if necessary.
   - Conduct a thorough review of all recently executed scripts within the profile.
5. **Documentation:** Record findings and response actions for future reference and improvement in detection strategies.
