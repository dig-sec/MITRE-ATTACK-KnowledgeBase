# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using container technology. Specifically, it focuses on identifying actions where adversaries attempt to evade detection by exploiting weaknesses in encryption or using containers to hide their activities.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1600 - Weaken Encryption
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Network  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages network traffic analysis and container orchestration logs to identify patterns indicative of bypass attempts. Key data sources include:

- Container network traffic (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Logs from orchestrators like Kubernetes API server
- File integrity monitoring systems

Pattern analysis focuses on unusual encryption-related activities within containers, such as unexpected changes in encryption protocols or unauthorized access to cryptographic keys.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may weaken encryption by manipulating configurations or exploiting vulnerabilities within containerized environments. Common tactics include:

- Modifying container images to include backdoors
- Using compromised images from repositories
- Altering network policies to bypass monitoring

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - `docker run --rm -it <image> /bin/bash`
  - `kubectl create -f ./compromised-pod.yaml`
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a container with known vulnerabilities and observe network traffic for anomalies.
  - Introduce unauthorized encryption libraries into a container image.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all containers are monitored, which may not be the case in larger environments.
- Relies on accurate logging from orchestrators; misconfigurations can lead to blind spots.
- Does not account for encrypted traffic without proper decryption capabilities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:

- Legitimate updates to encryption libraries within containers.
- Routine changes to network policies by system administrators.
- Automated deployment scripts that modify container configurations.

## Priority
**High:** The ability to bypass security monitoring poses a significant threat, allowing adversaries to move laterally and exfiltrate data undetected. Early detection is crucial for maintaining the integrity of sensitive environments.

## Response
When an alert fires:

1. **Verify Alert Validity:** Confirm if the alert corresponds to known benign activities.
2. **Isolate Affected Containers:** Immediately isolate any containers flagged by the alert to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis:** Examine logs and network traffic for signs of compromise or unauthorized activity.
4. **Update Security Measures:** Patch vulnerabilities in container images and strengthen encryption protocols.

This report provides a comprehensive framework to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers, aligning with Palantir's ADS strategy. Implementing this detection method enhances the ability to identify and respond to sophisticated evasion tactics effectively.
