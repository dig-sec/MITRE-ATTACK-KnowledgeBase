# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by leveraging container technology. This includes the deployment and utilization of containers within enterprise environments that may be utilized for malicious purposes, such as evading detection or hiding malicious activities.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing container-related activities across various platforms to identify patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. The key data sources include container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), host system logs, network traffic associated with containers, and security events from cloud environments such as Azure AD and Google Workspace.

Patterns analyzed may involve:
- Anomalies in container deployment frequencies or configurations.
- Unexpected network communications between containers and external entities.
- Unusual account activities related to container management.
- Discrepancies between declared container images and actual deployed versions.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit container technologies due to their lightweight nature and ease of deployment. By deploying malicious containers, adversaries can execute payloads without being detected by traditional security tools that may not be optimized for container environments. Techniques include creating ephemeral containers to perform malicious activities and then disposing of them quickly before detection.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - `docker run -d --rm <malicious_image>`
  - `kubectl create deployment <deployment_name> --image=<malicious_image>`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a benign container and monitor its behavior to establish a baseline.
  - Introduce a malicious container with irregular network activities or unexpected resource usage patterns.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** 
  - Detection might miss new or highly obfuscated containers that mimic legitimate processes closely.
  - Containers using sophisticated evasion techniques such as multi-stage builds or nested containers could be undetected.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment is adequately instrumented to capture detailed container activity logs.
  - Security teams have baseline knowledge of typical container behavior within their organization.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate development or testing environments using containers for short-lived tasks.
- Routine updates and deployments in CI/CD pipelines that involve container redeployments.
- Misconfigurations leading to excessive logging or unusual activity patterns that are not malicious.

## Priority
**High.** The use of containers by adversaries represents a significant threat due to their ability to quickly scale, move laterally across environments, and evade detection. Organizations with substantial containerized workloads must prioritize detecting adversarial attempts to leverage these technologies for malicious purposes.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no specific step-by-step instructions available for adversary emulation of this technique within a test environment. However, organizations can conduct red team exercises focusing on container usage and observe the effectiveness of their detection strategies.

## Response
When an alert related to adversarial container activities is triggered:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quiesce or isolate the suspected containers and associated resources.
2. **Incident Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis using collected logs and forensic tools to determine the nature of the activity.
3. **Communication:** Notify relevant stakeholders, including security teams and cloud service providers if applicable.
4. **Mitigation:** Implement necessary mitigations such as patching vulnerabilities or revising container deployment policies.
5. **Post-Incident Review:** Evaluate the incident response process and update detection strategies to prevent recurrence.

## Additional Resources
As of now, additional references and contextual information are not available. Security teams should leverage community forums, vendor documentation, and threat intelligence sources for further insights into emerging threats related to container security.
