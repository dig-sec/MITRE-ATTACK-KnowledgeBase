# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The primary goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to execute Python scripts for malicious purposes, including but not limited to bypassing security monitoring mechanisms using containers across different platforms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1059.006 - Python
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring for unusual or unauthorized execution of Python scripts. Key data sources include system logs (such as process creation events), network traffic, and file access logs. Patterns analyzed involve:
- Execution of Python via command-line arguments.
- Scripts that leverage the `pty` module to spawn shells.
- Usage of Python executables in contexts where such activity is uncommon.

## Technical Context
Adversaries use Python due to its versatility and ease of execution across platforms. They often execute scripts using various methods to avoid detection, including:
- Running Python directly with command-line arguments.
- Executing through shell scripts.
- Using `pty` module functions like `spawn` to mask the true nature of the process.

Adversaries might leverage libraries or frameworks that abstract the complexity of such executions. These techniques are often deployed in environments where security monitoring is either absent or can be easily circumvented, making them suitable for stealth operations within containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Legitimate use cases where Python scripts are commonly run as part of normal business processes.
  - Encrypted traffic that may hide script execution details.
  - Execution environments with restricted logging capabilities.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The security monitoring tools have access to the necessary logs and data sources for analysis.
  - There is a baseline understanding of typical Python usage patterns within the organization's environment.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Routine execution of legitimate Python scripts as part of software development or IT operations.
- Scheduled tasks or maintenance scripts running during off-hours.
- Use of Python in educational environments for learning purposes.

To minimize false positives, it is crucial to establish a baseline of normal behavior and correlate detected events with other suspicious activities.

## Priority
**Priority Level:** High

**Justification:**
The use of Python by adversaries can lead to significant security breaches due to its capability to perform complex operations stealthily. Given the widespread use of containers in modern IT environments, detecting such adversarial actions is critical for maintaining robust security postures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Execute shell script via Python's command mode argument:**
   - Command: `python3 -c "import os; os.system('echo Test > /tmp/test.txt')"`
   
2. **Execute Python via scripts:**
   - Create a script `script.py` with the content:
     ```python
     import os
     os.system("echo Script Execution > /tmp/script_test.txt")
     ```
   - Execute: `python3 script.py`

3. **Execute Python via Python executables:**
   - Command: `python3 -m subprocess -- python3 -c "import os; os.system('echo Executable Test > /tmp/executable_test.txt')"`
   
4. **Python pty module and spawn function used to spawn sh or bash:**
   - Create a script `pty_example.py` with the content:
     ```python
     import pty
     import subprocess

     def spawn_shell():
         (child_pid, fd) = pty.fork()
         if child_pid == 0:
             subprocess.call(["/bin/bash"])
         else:
             os.close(fd)

     spawn_shell()
     ```
   - Execute: `python3 pty_example.py`

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate and inspect the affected systems.
- Review logs to identify the source and context of the execution.
- Determine if any sensitive data or critical processes were accessed or modified.
- Update incident response plans based on findings.

Additional references and context are currently not available. Analysts are encouraged to use organizational knowledge bases, threat intelligence feeds, and internal documentation to further contextualize and respond to alerts effectively.
