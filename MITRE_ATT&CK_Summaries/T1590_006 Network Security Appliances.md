# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using containerization techniques.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Proxy, Redirection, and Evasion)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring network traffic patterns and logs from container orchestration platforms such as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. By analyzing anomalies in container deployment, runtime behavior, and inter-container communication, the system aims to identify attempts at evading security mechanisms. Key data sources include container logs, network flow data, and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS).

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers for their lightweight nature and ability to isolate processes, making them appealing for deploying malicious payloads without easily being detected by traditional security tools. They may execute this technique by:

1. Deploying containers with misconfigured network settings.
2. Using container escape techniques to gain access to the host OS.
3. Leveraging sidecar or microservice architectures to hide their activities.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

- **Sample Command:** `docker run -d --network=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN <malicious_image>`
  
- **Test Scenario:** Simulate an adversary deploying a container with elevated privileges and host network access, attempting to communicate with external C2 servers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
1. **Blind Spot:** The strategy may not detect sophisticated adversaries who leverage zero-day vulnerabilities within container platforms.
   
2. **Assumption:** It assumes that all containers are deployed in a monitored environment where baseline behaviors have been established.

3. **Gap:** Limited visibility into encrypted inter-container communications might hinder detection capabilities.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of host networking for performance optimization by applications.
- Misconfigurations or errors during container deployment that mimic adversarial activity.
- Routine updates or maintenance activities involving privileged containers.

## Priority
**Priority Level: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant threat, as it can lead to undetected lateral movement and data exfiltration within an organization's network. Given the widespread adoption of container technology in modern IT environments, this technique is both relevant and potentially impactful.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are not currently available due to the complexity and potential risk involved. Organizations should conduct controlled tests with strict oversight and within isolated networks to minimize impact.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. Immediately isolate the affected containers and hosts.
2. Review container logs for suspicious activities or unexpected network connections.
3. Conduct a thorough assessment of the host system for signs of compromise.
4. Update security policies and controls based on findings to prevent recurrence.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently not available. Organizations may refer to general resources on container security best practices and threat intelligence reports related to container-based attacks.
