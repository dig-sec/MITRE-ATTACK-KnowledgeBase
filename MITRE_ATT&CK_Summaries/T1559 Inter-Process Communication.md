# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the use of inter-process communication mechanisms, focusing on techniques like named pipes, memory-mapped files, and other IPC methods that adversaries utilize to execute commands or transfer data covertly.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of network and host-based data sources to identify suspicious IPC activities. By analyzing patterns such as unusual process creation, unexpected parent-child process relationships, anomalous memory usage, or network traffic indicative of named pipe communication, the system aims to detect adversaries' attempts to use IPC for malicious purposes.

### Data Sources Utilized:
- **Network Traffic:** Monitoring for unusual patterns in traffic that may indicate IPC activity.
- **Process and Memory Events:** Tracking process creations, terminations, and parent-child relationships that deviate from established baselines.
- **File System Activity:** Observing changes to files or directories commonly used by IPC mechanisms.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Unusual creation of named pipes or other IPC objects.
- Processes with unexpected communication patterns.
- Memory-mapped file usage inconsistent with normal behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use IPC techniques to evade detection and execute commands across different processes. For example, they may create a named pipe on a Windows system and leverage it for command execution or data transfer between malicious processes. These techniques can be particularly challenging to detect because they mimic legitimate inter-process communication used by trusted applications.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit Pipe:** Used for creating artifacts that adversaries might leave behind.
- **Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) Pipe:** Mimics command and control activity via PowerShell remoting.
- **SSH (postex_ssh) Pipe:** Utilizes SSH sessions to move laterally within a network covertly.
- **Post-exploitation Pipes (4.2 and later):** Simulates advanced exploitation techniques available in newer versions of Cobalt Strike.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes baseline normal behavior is well-established, which may not be accurate for dynamic environments.
- May miss detection if adversaries employ custom or less common IPC methods not covered by current models.
- Relies on the assumption that network traffic patterns can reliably indicate IPC activity without significant false positives.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger alerts include:
- Legitimate use of named pipes in enterprise applications.
- Standard process communication between trusted processes.
- Scheduled tasks or automation scripts using memory-mapped files for legitimate purposes.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring poses a significant risk, as it allows adversaries to operate undetected within an environment. Detecting and mitigating such activities is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit Pipe:**
   - Deploy Cobalt Strike on a target machine.
   - Use the "artifact kit" command to create test artifacts indicative of IPC activity.

2. **Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) Pipe:**
   - Execute `psexec_psh` to simulate lateral movement using PowerShell remoting.
   - Monitor for unusual process creation and network traffic patterns.

3. **Cobalt Strike SSH (postex_ssh) Pipe:**
   - Establish an SSH session using `postex_ssh`.
   - Observe the communication between processes through the established session.

4. **Cobalt Strike Post-exploitation Pipe (4.2 and later):**
   - Utilize post-exploitation modules to create IPC channels.
   - Analyze process and memory events for suspicious activities.

5. **Cobalt Strike Post-exploitation Pipe (before 4.2):**
   - Employ older versions of Cobalt Strike to test detection capabilities against legacy techniques.
   - Validate the system's ability to detect known patterns from previous versions.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the scope and impact of the IPC activity.
- Review logs for related events that might indicate additional compromised processes or systems.
- Update detection models based on findings to improve future accuracy.
