# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containerization technologies.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1584.005 - Botnet  
  - This mapping indicates the focus on adversarial use of botnets to establish resource infrastructure that can be leveraged for malicious activities.
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development  
  - The aim is to identify and disrupt efforts to set up resources required for conducting cyber operations, such as command-and-control (C2) servers hosted in containers.
- **Platforms:** PRE  
  - Platforms include any infrastructure supporting Pre-exploitation activities where adversaries prepare their botnets.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages log data from container orchestrators (such as Kubernetes) and host-based security tools to identify suspicious activity patterns associated with adversarial attempts at bypassing monitoring. Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual image pull requests or deployments from unauthorized repositories.
- Anomalous network traffic originating from containers, indicative of C2 communications.
- Container restarts or resource spikes that deviate from typical baseline behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containerization to deploy and manage botnets due to its flexibility and ability to evade detection. Techniques include:

- Deploying a malicious container image in a cloud environment to establish a covert C2 server.
- Using orchestrated containers for scalable and resilient command infrastructure.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
Real-world execution involves adversaries creating custom Docker images with embedded malware or exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate applications deployed within containers. Test scenarios might include:

1. Deploying a container with a known malicious image from an untrusted repository.
2. Configuring the container to establish outbound connections mimicking C2 traffic.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not cover stealthy, low-and-slow attacks or those using legitimate images with slight modifications.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that security baselines for typical container activity are established, which might not always be the case in dynamic environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers for rapid deployment and testing within development environments.
- Scheduled maintenance or updates causing temporary spikes in network traffic or restarts.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
Justification: The ability to bypass monitoring using containerization poses a significant threat, enabling adversaries to maintain persistent access with reduced detection risk.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
No current emulation scenarios are available for this technique. Steps to develop emulation could involve:

1. Setting up a test environment with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
2. Deploying a benign yet complex container image that mimics malicious behavior patterns.
3. Simulating network traffic and monitoring system alerts.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:

- Verify the legitimacy of unusual container activity by cross-referencing with known good baselines.
- Isolate suspicious containers to prevent potential spread or communication with external C2 servers.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the source and nature of unauthorized repository access or image deployments.
