# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Scheduled Transfer (T1029)

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using scheduled data transfers. This involves identifying unauthorized or suspicious transfer activities orchestrated by adversaries aiming to exfiltrate data at specific intervals.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1029 - Scheduled Transfer
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Exfiltration
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages various data sources, including file system monitoring, network traffic analysis, and task scheduler logs. It focuses on identifying patterns such as unexpected scheduled tasks or anomalous transfer activities. Key indicators include:

- Unusual creation of scheduled tasks or cron jobs.
- Unexpected outbound network connections during off-hours.
- File modifications followed by immediate scheduling for data transfers.

The strategy employs heuristic and anomaly-based detection techniques to flag potential malicious activity while minimizing false positives.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use legitimate system tools like Windows Task Scheduler, cron jobs on Linux/macOS, or third-party automation tools to schedule data transfers. These activities are typically masked as routine operations but may serve as a covert channel for exfiltration.

### Adversary Emulation Details

- **Windows:** Creation of tasks using `schtasks` to periodically transfer files.
  - Example Command: `schtasks /create /tn "BackupTask" /tr "C:\scripts\backup.bat" /sc daily /st 02:00`
  
- **Linux/macOS:** Scheduling cron jobs for data transfers.
  - Example Cron Entry: 
    ```
    0 2 * * * /usr/bin/rsync -avz /home/user/data user@remotehost:/path/to/destination
    ```

Test scenarios may involve setting up a controlled environment where these tasks are monitored to understand their behavior and detect anomalies.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss sophisticated obfuscation techniques that disguise scheduled transfers as legitimate processes.
  - Limited visibility into encrypted network traffic without proper decryption capabilities.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Scheduled tasks are assumed to be created or modified by users with appropriate system privileges.
  - Network baselines are established and monitored for anomaly detection.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate backup processes scheduled during off-hours.
- Routine file synchronization tasks between authorized systems.
- Software updates or maintenance scripts running as part of organizational policies.

## Priority
**High**

Justification: Scheduled transfers are a common method for exfiltrating data without immediate detection. The potential impact includes significant data loss and breaches of sensitive information, making it imperative to prioritize their detection.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available for adversary emulation in a test environment. However, creating controlled scenarios with scheduled tasks mimicking malicious activities can help validate the strategy.

## Response
When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the scheduled task or cron job.
   - Review network traffic logs to determine if data is being transferred to unauthorized destinations.

2. **Containment:**
   - Disable suspicious tasks immediately.
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further data loss.

3. **Analysis and Documentation:**
   - Conduct a thorough analysis to understand the scope of the scheduled transfer.
   - Document findings for future reference and improvement of detection strategies.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Update security policies to restrict unauthorized creation or modification of scheduled tasks.
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect similar activities more effectively in the future.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references are available. Further research and collaboration with industry peers may provide deeper insights into advanced detection techniques for T1029.
