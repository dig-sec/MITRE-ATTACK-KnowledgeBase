# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Software Packing (T1027.002)

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using software packing techniques, specifically UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables). This technique allows adversaries to conceal malicious payloads within packed binaries, making it harder for traditional signature-based security measures to detect them.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy utilizes a combination of process monitoring and file integrity checks to identify packed binaries. The strategy involves analyzing patterns in executable files for anomalies indicative of packing, such as abnormal size changes or unusual header modifications. Data sources include endpoint logs, file metadata, and network traffic analysis. By correlating these data points, the system can detect potential software packing attempts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use software packing to obfuscate their malicious code, making it difficult for security tools to analyze and detect them. UPX is a popular tool used for packing executables on Linux systems. In real-world scenarios, adversaries may pack binaries with or without modifying headers to evade detection. This technique can be part of a broader strategy to bypass antivirus solutions and other security monitoring tools.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Packing an executable using UPX:
    ```bash
    upx --best /path/to/binary
    ```
  - Modifying headers after packing:
    ```bash
    hexedit /path/to/packed_binary
    ```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Binary Simply Packed by UPX (Linux):** Use UPX to compress an executable and observe changes in file size and metadata.
2. **Binary Packed by UPX, with Modified Headers (Linux):** After packing, alter the headers using a hex editor to test detection capabilities.
3. **Repetition of Steps 1 and 2:** Validate detection consistency across multiple scenarios.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection relies on specific patterns in file metadata and process behavior, which may evolve as adversaries develop new packing techniques.
- Assumes that packed binaries exhibit detectable anomalies compared to unpacked versions.
- May not cover all variations of software packing tools beyond UPX or those employing advanced obfuscation methods.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of UPX by developers for compressing non-malicious applications.
- Software development and testing environments where packed binaries are part of normal operations.
- False positives may arise from benign software updates that involve packing.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While software packing is a common evasion technique, its detection is crucial to maintaining robust security posture. However, given the potential for false positives in legitimate development scenarios, it requires careful tuning and validation.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Ensure you have a Linux environment with UPX installed.
   - Prepare a benign binary to use as test data.

2. **Binary Simply Packed by UPX:**
   ```bash
   upx --best /path/to/binary
   ```

3. **Analyze Changes:**
   - Check for changes in file size and metadata using tools like `stat` or `file`.
   - Monitor any process anomalies when executing the packed binary.

4. **Binary Packed by UPX, with Modified Headers:**
   ```bash
   upx --best /path/to/binary
   hexedit /path/to/packed_binary
   ```

5. **Re-evaluate Detection:**
   - Repeat analysis steps to ensure detection mechanisms can identify both packed and header-modified binaries.

6. **Document Observations:**
   - Record any detected anomalies or failures in detection for further refinement of the strategy.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- Verify if the binary was legitimately packed using tools like UPX.
- Conduct a deeper analysis to determine if the binary exhibits malicious behavior.
- Isolate and quarantine the suspicious file for further investigation.
- Update security tools with new signatures or indicators of compromise (IOCs) derived from the analysis.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available. Continuous monitoring of emerging threats and community forums is recommended to stay updated on new packing techniques and detection methods.
