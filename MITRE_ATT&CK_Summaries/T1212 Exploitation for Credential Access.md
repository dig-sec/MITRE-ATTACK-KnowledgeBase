# Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Use of Containers to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containerization technologies. Specifically, it focuses on identifying when adversaries leverage containers to conceal their activities from traditional detection systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy revolves around monitoring container activity and identifying anomalous behavior indicative of adversarial use. Data sources include container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), host system logs, network traffic, and file integrity monitoring outputs. Key patterns analyzed involve unusual resource usage spikes, unexpected network connections from within containers, and attempts to access sensitive files or credentials.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit container technologies for several reasons:
- **Isolation:** Containers can isolate malicious processes from detection by conventional security tools.
- **Evasion:** By running in ephemeral environments, adversaries attempt to evade persistent monitoring systems.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Containers might be used to escalate privileges within a host system.

Adversaries typically execute these techniques using commands such as `docker run` or `kubectl exec`, often employing known container escape tactics (e.g., CVE-2019-5736) to gain unauthorized access. Test scenarios include deploying containers with elevated privileges and monitoring for unauthorized file accesses or network communications.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection might miss sophisticated evasion techniques that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in container runtimes.
  - Encrypted traffic within containers can obscure malicious activities from analysis.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has comprehensive logging enabled for all container-related activities.
  - Security tools are configured to monitor and alert on unusual patterns of behavior.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers by developers for testing or deployment purposes.
- Network scanning or testing performed during maintenance windows within isolated environments.
- Resource-intensive applications running in containers without malicious intent.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

The detection strategy is prioritized as high due to the critical nature of containerization technologies in modern IT infrastructures and their potential misuse by adversaries. The ability to bypass security controls poses a significant threat, making timely detection essential for maintaining organizational security.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:
1. Set up a containerized environment using Docker or Kubernetes.
2. Deploy containers with varying levels of privileges.
3. Use commands like `docker run -it --privileged <image>` to simulate adversarial actions.
4. Attempt known container escape techniques (e.g., CVE-2019-5736) to verify detection capabilities.
5. Monitor logs and alerts for unauthorized activities.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
1. Immediately isolate the affected containers and hosts from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation of container logs, host system events, and network traffic to identify the scope of compromise.
3. Update security controls to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and close any detected gaps in monitoring.
4. Collaborate with development teams to ensure application code does not inadvertently introduce security risks.
