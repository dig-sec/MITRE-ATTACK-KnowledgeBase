# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that aim to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging containers. This involves identifying scenarios where adversaries use containerization technologies to obscure their activities and evade detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activity to identify unusual patterns that may suggest adversarial intent. Key data sources include:

1. **Container Orchestrators Logs:** Such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm logs, which provide insights into container creation, execution, and lifecycle events.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring for unexpected communication between containers or with external entities.
3. **File System Changes:** Observing modifications in container file systems that could indicate malicious activities.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Creation of numerous short-lived containers.
- Unusual network traffic originating from specific containers.
- Unexpected changes to system binaries or sensitive files within containers.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit container technologies for several reasons, such as using containers to execute code in an isolated environment that is harder to detect. They might use legitimate container management tools to create and manage these environments stealthily.

**Real-world Execution:**
- Adversaries often utilize scripting or orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes scripts) to deploy multiple containers.
- They may exploit vulnerabilities within the container runtime or orchestrator to gain elevated privileges.
  
**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- Sample commands for adversary emulation might include using Docker CLI commands like `docker run` to spin up containers rapidly, with varied configurations and network settings.
- Test scenarios could involve deploying a benign application in multiple containers and monitoring how it interacts with the host system and other containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

### Known Limitations:
- **Evasion Techniques:** Adversaries may employ sophisticated evasion techniques like namespace isolation to further obscure their activities.
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited computational resources might restrict the ability to monitor all container events in real-time.
  
### Assumptions:
- It is assumed that adversaries will interact with known network endpoints or alter files within containers, which can be monitored effectively.
- Assumes access to detailed logging from orchestrators and hosts.

## False Positives

Potential false positives include:

- Legitimate DevOps practices such as deploying temporary testing environments using containers.
- Routine system maintenance tasks that involve container manipulation.
- Automated scaling actions by legitimate applications in response to load changes.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

**Justification:**
The ability of adversaries to use containers for evasion represents a significant threat, especially in environments with extensive container usage. Given the critical nature of detecting such attempts early, this technique is prioritized highly due to its potential impact on security posture and operational integrity.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no specific step-by-step adversary emulation instructions are available for this detection strategy. However, organizations can develop scenarios that mimic adversarial behavior by:

1. Deploying benign containers using tools like Docker or Kubernetes.
2. Simulating network traffic patterns typical of an attacker trying to communicate with a command and control server.
3. Altering container file systems to observe detection system responses.

## Response

When alerts for this technique are triggered, analysts should:

- **Investigate the Source:** Determine the origin of the suspicious activity by reviewing logs from orchestrators and hosts.
- **Assess Impact:** Evaluate any potential impact on the network or applications due to the containers' activities.
- **Containment:** If malicious intent is confirmed, take steps to isolate affected containers and prevent further spread.
- **Remediation:** Patch vulnerabilities in container runtimes or orchestrators that were exploited.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional resources are available. Organizations may consider consulting with security experts specializing in containerized environments for more tailored strategies and insights.
