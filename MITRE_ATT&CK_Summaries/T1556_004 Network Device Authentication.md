## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring network traffic for anomalies associated with containerized environments that indicate attempts to use compromised credentials or misconfigured devices for unauthorized access. Key data sources include network logs, container orchestration system logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), and endpoint security solutions. Patterns analyzed involve unusual authentication requests from known containers, irregularities in authentication timing, volume of failed login attempts, and deviations from established baseline behaviors for device communications.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit weak or compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access to network devices via containers that obscure their activities. This technique typically involves attackers leveraging tools like SSH or Telnet within a containerized environment to manipulate or bypass traditional security controls unnoticed. Adversary emulation could include commands such as configuring a Docker container with an SSH server and using brute force attacks to authenticate against a target device.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- Deploy a Docker container with an SSH server.
- Use tools like `hydra` to perform automated login attempts on a network device within the same subnet.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all containers are part of a monitored environment.
- Detection may miss activities if adversaries employ zero-day vulnerabilities or advanced evasion techniques not covered by current patterns.
- Dependence on accurate baseline behavior modeling; anomalies might be missed in highly dynamic environments.

## False Positives
- Legitimate network devices performing routine authentication requests post-update.
- Authorized IT personnel conducting legitimate security audits or maintenance tasks using containers.
- Network reconfigurations leading to temporary increases in failed login attempts.

## Priority
**High**: This technique addresses a critical vector for bypassing traditional monitoring systems. Containers are widely used, and adversaries often exploit them due to their inherent complexity and flexibility, making detection crucial.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Review the container logs and network traffic associated with the alert.
2. **Verify Legitimacy:** Confirm if the activity is part of a scheduled maintenance or audit process.
3. **Containment:** Isolate any compromised containers to prevent further unauthorized access.
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify how the adversary gained credentials or accessed the system, and mitigate vulnerabilities.
5. **Update Policies:** Enhance monitoring rules and improve credential management practices.

## Additional Resources
- No additional resources available at this time. Further research and community collaboration may provide more insights into effective detection strategies.
