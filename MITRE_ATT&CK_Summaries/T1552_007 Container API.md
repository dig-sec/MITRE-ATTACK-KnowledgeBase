# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that exploit container technologies to bypass security monitoring systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1552.007 - Container API
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Containers

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages logs and telemetry data from container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes. By analyzing API calls related to secrets management within these environments, we can identify unauthorized access attempts or anomalous behavior indicative of adversarial activities.

### Data Sources Utilized:
- **Kubernetes Audit Logs:** To monitor `Secret` and `ServiceAccountToken` operations.
- **Container Runtime Logs:** For abnormal resource usage patterns indicating potential exploitation.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** To detect unusual communication with external IP addresses or domains.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Unauthorized access attempts to Kubernetes secrets.
- Anomalous API calls targeting secret management endpoints.
- Unexpected changes in service account tokens or elevated privileges.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containers by leveraging the Kubernetes API to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Common methods include:

1. **Accessing Secrets:** Adversaries might use container workloads with excessive permissions to list and read secrets.
2. **Manipulating Tokens:** They could retrieve service account tokens from the file system within a pod, granting them control over other pods or services.

### Real-World Execution:
Adversaries often escalate privileges by exploiting misconfigurations in role-based access controls (RBAC) or leveraging compromised credentials.

#### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `kubectl get secret --all-namespaces`
  - `cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes proper RBAC configurations are in place; misconfigurations might allow unauthorized access without detection.
- Detection efficacy relies on comprehensive logging being enabled for audit trails.
- May not detect adversaries using ephemeral containers that evade long-term monitoring.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks performed by system operators or developers, such as routine secret management.
- Automated deployment scripts accessing secrets in a controlled and expected manner.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

This detection strategy is prioritized highly due to the critical nature of credential access within container environments. Unauthorized access can lead to widespread compromise across an organizationâ€™s infrastructure if not detected promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection technique, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **List All Secrets:**
   - Execute `kubectl get secret --all-namespaces` to list all available secrets.
   
2. **Inspect Secret Details:**
   - Use `kubectl describe secret <secret-name>` to inspect the details of individual secrets.

3. **Cat the contents of a Kubernetes Service Account Token File:**
   - Inside an authorized pod, run `cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` to view the service account token.

Ensure all activities are conducted with proper authorization and in compliance with organizational policies.

## Response
Upon detection of suspicious activity related to secrets management:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Temporarily isolate affected pods or namespaces to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Review Kubernetes audit logs for unusual patterns or repeated attempts.
   - Verify the integrity and configuration of RBAC policies.
3. **Alerting:**
   - Notify security operations teams for further analysis and incident response.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Rotate compromised secrets and service account tokens.
   - Update and enforce stricter access controls.
