# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
Detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers on both Linux and Windows platforms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1505.002 - Transport Agent
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis and system process monitoring to identify attempts by adversaries to deploy transport agents within container environments. Key data sources include:
- **Network Traffic:** Anomalies in outbound connections or unusual patterns related to known container communication protocols.
- **System Logs:** Unusual processes running on host systems that are indicative of transport agent activities, particularly those involving MS Exchange.

Patterns analyzed encompass unexpected process behavior, unauthorized access to critical directories, and deviations from normal operational baselines specific to containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use transport agents as a method for establishing persistence by executing malicious code within the communication frameworks of applications like MS Exchange. In real-world scenarios, adversaries may deploy these agents using PowerShell scripts or through direct manipulation of configuration files on host systems.

**Example Commands:**
- Adversaries might use `Invoke-Command` with a script to inject transport agent code.
- Configuration changes in `TransportAgentConfig.xml` could indicate unauthorized modifications.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover zero-day exploits or novel variations of known techniques that do not exhibit detectable patterns.
  - Encrypted traffic might obscure network-based indicators, making detection more challenging.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes baseline behavior models are accurate and up-to-date for detecting anomalies.
  - Depends on timely updates to threat intelligence feeds for recognizing new malicious signatures or command variants.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development or testing environments where similar processes might be observed.
- Scheduled tasks or automated scripts executing maintenance tasks involving MS Exchange, which mimic transport agent behavior.

## Priority
**High**

Justification: The technique poses a significant threat due to its ability to establish persistence and evade detection through containerization. Given the critical role of email servers like MS Exchange in organizational operations, any compromise could lead to severe data breaches or disruptions.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a controlled test environment:

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure you have a virtualized environment with both Linux and Windows systems.
   - Deploy container orchestration tools like Docker or Kubernetes for testing.

2. **Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence:**
   - On a Windows machine, configure MS Exchange with the necessary permissions.
   - Use PowerShell to simulate adversary actions:
     ```powershell
     Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { New-TransportRule -Name "TestAgent" -From "test@example.com" -SentToScope NotInOrganization }
     ```

3. **Analyze Indicators:**
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.
   - Check system logs on both host and container layers for unauthorized process activities.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Isolate Affected Systems:** Disconnect the affected systems from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Examine Logs and Traffic:** Review detailed logs and captured traffic to understand the scope of the activity.
3. **Identify Compromised Accounts/Processes:** Determine if specific accounts or processes were used, focusing on any unauthorized changes to MS Exchange configurations.
4. **Remediate and Restore:** Remove malicious components and restore system integrity using clean backups if necessary.
5. **Update Detection Rules:** Adjust detection rules based on findings to reduce false positives.

This ADS framework provides a comprehensive approach to detecting adversarial attempts using transport agents within containers, focusing on critical infrastructure like MS Exchange. By following these guidelines, organizations can strengthen their detection and response capabilities.
