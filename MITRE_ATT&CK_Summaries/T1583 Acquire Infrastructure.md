# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containerization technology. Attackers exploit containers to obfuscate malicious activities, making detection and response more challenging.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous patterns associated with container usage that may indicate adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration platform logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Host system logs (systemd/journald, syslog)
- Network traffic analysis

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unexpected or unauthorized creation and deployment of containers
- Anomalous network communications originating from containers
- Unusual CPU/memory usage spikes associated with specific container processes

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers for their lightweight nature, enabling rapid deployment and scaling of infrastructure without direct access to the host system. This approach allows them to execute commands or scripts within isolated environments while evading traditional endpoint detection systems.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Attackers might employ commands such as:
- `docker run -d --rm <image> <command>`
- `kubectl create deployment <name> --image=<image>`

To test this technique, simulate unauthorized container deployments and monitor for deviations from established baselines in network traffic or resource utilization.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development and testing may mimic adversarial patterns.
- Detection effectiveness is contingent on baseline establishment; new environments lack historical data.
- Encrypted network traffic can obscure detection efforts, requiring decryption capabilities.

Assumptions made in this strategy:
- Comprehensive logging is enabled across container orchestration platforms and host systems.
- Baselines are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect legitimate usage patterns.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment of containers as part of CI/CD pipelines.
- Resource-intensive applications running within containers during peak times.
- Authorized administrative operations involving container creation or updates.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
The technique allows adversaries to gain control over infrastructure while evading detection, potentially leading to significant breaches and data exfiltration. The high priority reflects the critical need for robust monitoring and anomaly detection in container environments.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster or Docker Swarm with logging enabled.
   
2. **Establish Baseline:**
   - Monitor normal operations over several days to identify typical patterns of container usage and network activity.

3. **Simulate Adversarial Actions:**
   - Run unauthorized containers using commands such as:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --rm <malicious_image>
     kubectl create deployment test --image=<malicious_image> --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
     ```
   - Monitor for unexpected container deployments and unusual network traffic.

4. **Analyze Alerts:**
   - Evaluate the alerts triggered by these actions against baseline patterns to refine detection rules.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected containers.
- Review logs for unauthorized access or anomalous activity.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of recent container deployments and network traffic.
- Update firewall rules to block suspicious IPs or services if necessary.
- Enhance monitoring policies based on findings to improve future detection accuracy.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently unavailable. Analysts should consult platform-specific documentation for detailed logging configurations and anomaly detection best practices.
