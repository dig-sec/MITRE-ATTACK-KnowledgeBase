# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Downgrade System Image

## Goal
The aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by downgrading system images, thus reverting systems to a state where the adversary can operate without modern security mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1601.002 - Downgrade System Image
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Network  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying patterns indicative of system image downgrading. Data sources include system logs, file integrity monitoring (FIM), and network traffic analysis. The key patterns analyzed are:
- Unusual changes in system configurations or registry settings that revert security mechanisms.
- Anomalous access to system restore points or recovery media.
- Network communications with known malicious IPs associated with supply chain attacks.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by manipulating system images through various methods, such as using administrative privileges to alter or replace current system files with older versions. This can be achieved by:
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in backup software.
- Using remote management tools to access and modify system state.
  
**Sample Commands:**
```bash
# Accessing system restore points
wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\default Path SystemRestore Call CreateRestorePoint "AttackRestore", 100, 7

# Reverting changes using command-line tools
sfc /scannow
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into encrypted network traffic where downgrade commands might be transmitted.
- **Assumptions:** The technique assumes that system logging is fully enabled and monitored.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate system maintenance tasks that involve reverting to previous versions for compatibility testing.
- Authorized administrators performing regular system recovery operations using built-in tools.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: This technique can significantly degrade security posture by disabling modern defenses, potentially allowing unimpeded execution of further malicious activities.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Due to the sensitive nature and potential impact on live environments, detailed adversary emulation steps are not provided. However, testing in isolated lab settings with similar system configurations is recommended.

## Response
When an alert for a suspected downgrade operation fires:
1. **Containment:** Immediately isolate affected systems from the network.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Review logs and change history to confirm unauthorized modifications.
   - Analyze network traffic for indicators of compromise (IoCs).
3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore systems using known clean backups.
   - Patch vulnerabilities exploited during the attack.
4. **Post-Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough review to understand how the downgrade occurred.
   - Update detection rules and response plans based on findings.

Currently, no additional references or context are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework documentation provided. Future resources may include case studies of incidents involving system image downgrades.
