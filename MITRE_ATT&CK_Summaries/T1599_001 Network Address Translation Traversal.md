# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. By leveraging network and container-specific data sources, the goal is to detect when attackers use containers for obfuscation or evasion of traditional security defenses.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1599.001 - Network Address Translation Traversal
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Network
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599/001)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy utilizes a combination of network traffic analysis and container orchestration logs. The primary data sources include:

1. **Network Traffic Logs**: Monitor for unusual patterns in internal network communication, especially focusing on the use of Network Address Translation (NAT) that might indicate attempts to traverse through it.
2. **Container Orchestration Systems**: Analyze logs from systems like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm for anomalies such as unexpected container creation or resource allocation.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual NAT traversal patterns indicating potential masking of true IP addresses.
- Anomalous behaviors in container orchestration, such as rapid scaling of containers that may suggest an attempt to create a large number of decoy processes to overwhelm monitoring tools.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use containers for Defense Evasion by exploiting their isolated environments and network configurations. Techniques include:

- **Using NAT Traversal**: Attackers can mask the origin IP address using NAT, making it difficult to track malicious activities.
- **Container Spraying**: Rapidly launching multiple containers with similar characteristics to obscure malicious activity.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

- Command: `docker run -d --rm --network=host <malicious_image>`
- Scenario: Simulate the rapid creation of containers within a Kubernetes cluster, each configured to make network requests through NAT.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots**:
  - Detection may miss sophisticated evasion techniques that dynamically alter their signatures.
  - Potential lack of visibility into encrypted traffic without proper decryption mechanisms in place.

- **Assumptions**:
  - The underlying monitoring systems have access to detailed network logs and container orchestration logs.
  - Network segmentation is adequately implemented, allowing for effective isolation and detection of suspicious activities.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate rapid scaling operations in a microservices environment where containers are dynamically created or destroyed based on load.
- Authorized use of NAT traversal by internal applications designed to mask IP addresses for privacy reasons.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification:
- The use of containers is prevalent, and adversaries exploiting them can significantly evade detection mechanisms.
- Containers offer a high degree of flexibility and isolation, making it an attractive vector for sophisticated attacks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

As of now, there are no specific step-by-step instructions available to emulate this technique in a test environment. Future efforts should focus on developing comprehensive scenarios that simulate real-world adversary tactics within controlled environments.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Analysts should promptly investigate the source of the alert by examining network traffic and container logs for unusual patterns.
2. **Isolate Suspect Containers**: Temporarily isolate containers identified as suspicious to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **Analyze Network Traffic**: Look for abnormal NAT traversal patterns that might indicate IP masking attempts.
4. **Review Orchestration Logs**: Check for unexpected changes in container orchestration, such as rapid scaling or unusual resource allocation.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional resources are available. Future enhancements should include detailed adversary emulation guides and updated threat intelligence feeds to refine detection capabilities.
