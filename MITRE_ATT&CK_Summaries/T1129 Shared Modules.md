# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using containerization on Windows platforms. The focus is on identifying when adversaries leverage containers as a method to execute malicious activities while evading detection.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of host and network data sources to identify patterns indicative of container misuse for malicious purposes. Key data sources include system logs, process monitoring, network traffic analysis, and configuration changes in virtual environments.

Patterns analyzed involve unusual or unauthorized installation and execution of containers, unexpected network connections originating from containerized processes, and discrepancies between expected and actual configurations of host systems and networks. Anomalies such as the presence of custom scripts or binaries within container images are also scrutinized.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit container technology to isolate malicious processes from traditional security monitoring mechanisms. This is often achieved by:
- Installing and configuring containers without proper authorization.
- Executing malware inside containers, using them as a layer to obscure activities.
- Bypassing host-level security controls by leveraging the isolated environment provided by containers.

Adversary emulation might include commands such as setting up Docker on Windows environments, creating custom container images with embedded malicious payloads, and running these containers in ways that mask their true purpose from detection tools.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection relies heavily on monitoring configuration changes and network traffic patterns. Insufficient logging can lead to missed indicators.
- Assumes a baseline of normal container usage within the environment; environments without existing container infrastructure might have different baselines.
- Relies on up-to-date threat intelligence to identify new or evolving tactics.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment and use of containers by authorized personnel for development, testing, or application delivery purposes.
- Network traffic from containers used in non-malicious internal communications.
- Automated scripts running container setup processes as part of a standard workflow.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers can significantly undermine an organization's defense posture. Containers are increasingly popular for their efficiency and scalability, making them attractive targets for adversaries looking to evade detection.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Set Up ESXi Host:**
   - Install VMware vSphere Client.
   - Configure an ESXi host to manage virtual machines.

2. **Install Custom VIB on ESXi Host:**
   - Prepare a custom Virtual Infrastructure Bundle (VIB) with embedded scripts for container deployment and execution.
   - Use `esxcli software vib install` command to apply the VIB:
     ```shell
     esxcli software vib install --vibpath=/path/to/custom.vib
     ```

3. **Configure and Run Containers:**
   - Set up Docker or another container runtime on a Windows-based VM managed by ESXi.
   - Create custom container images with embedded scripts that mimic malicious activity (e.g., unauthorized network connections).

4. **Monitor Execution:**
   - Use monitoring tools to track the installation, configuration changes, and execution of containers.
   - Simulate adversary behavior such as modifying image contents or executing unexpected commands.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential adversarial use of containers:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Review logs for recent container installations and configurations.
   - Analyze network traffic originating from the suspected containers.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Halt unauthorized or suspicious container processes.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any identified malicious containers or images.
   - Revert configuration changes and strengthen access controls for container deployment.

4. **Post-Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the incident to understand how the bypass was attempted.
   - Update detection rules and threat intelligence based on findings.
