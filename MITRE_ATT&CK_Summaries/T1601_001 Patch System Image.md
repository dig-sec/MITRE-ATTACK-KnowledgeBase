# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Patch System Image Detection

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to patch a system image to bypass security monitoring tools and hinder their ability to perform accurate detection.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1601.001 - Patch System Image
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Network
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying patterns and anomalies associated with the patching of system images that might indicate adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- **System logs:** Monitoring for unauthorized access to system image files.
- **File integrity monitoring (FIM):** Detect changes in critical system files or directories.
- **Network traffic analysis:** Identifying unusual network activity related to file transfers involving the system image.

The strategy looks for patterns such as unauthorized modification of system image files, discrepancies between backup and current system images, and unexpected access attempts to system image locations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by directly modifying a bootable system image or altering it post-deployment. This can be done using tools that allow image manipulation or through direct file system changes if the adversary has sufficient privileges.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Using `dd` to create a backup of the system image:
    ```bash
    sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/backup/system_image.img bs=4M
    ```
  - Altering or replacing parts of an image using image manipulation tools (e.g., modifying `initrd` or boot configurations).

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Simulating unauthorized access to modify the system image.
  - Observing network traffic for unusual data transfers involving system images.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not cover all methods of patching, especially those using advanced techniques or custom tools.
  - Encrypted traffic could obscure malicious activities.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes a baseline level of security monitoring is already in place (e.g., FIM, logging).
  - Relies on the accuracy and completeness of logs and file integrity baselines.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate system maintenance or updates to system images.
- Authorized IT personnel performing routine backups or modifications for testing purposes.
- Software deployment processes involving image manipulation during development cycles.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
- Patching a system image can significantly undermine an organization's security posture by evading detection mechanisms and enabling persistent access for adversaries. The high priority reflects the severe impact of such an evasion technique on organizational defenses.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific instructions are available to emulate this technique in a controlled test environment. Organizations may need to develop custom scenarios based on their systems' configurations and operational procedures.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Assess the scope of changes made to the system image.
   - Verify if there have been unauthorized access attempts or modifications.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.
   - Revert changes using verified backup images, if possible.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough analysis to understand how the system image was modified and identify any remaining threats or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Evaluate security controls and update policies to prevent similar incidents.
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect future attempts more effectively.

## Additional Resources
No additional resources are currently available for this technique. Organizations should consider developing internal documentation based on their specific environment and threat landscape.
