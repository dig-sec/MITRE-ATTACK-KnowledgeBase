# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting containers. These activities may involve adversaries using valid accounts, evading detection mechanisms, gaining persistence, escalating privileges, or establishing initial access through containerized environments.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1078 - Valid Accounts
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Initial Access
- **Platforms:** Windows, Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Google Workspace, Containers

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container-related activities to identify adversarial behavior. It leverages data sources such as container logs, network traffic, system events, and identity access management systems.

Key patterns include:
- Unusual or unauthorized container deployments.
- Anomalies in network communication originating from containers.
- Unexpected changes in container configurations or permissions.
- Suspicious activity related to the use of valid accounts within container environments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containers by leveraging legitimate user credentials (T1078) to deploy malicious applications, maintain persistence through persistent volumes, evade detection via obfuscation techniques, and escalate privileges by exploiting misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

Real-world execution might involve:
- Compromising a container host and deploying rogue containers.
- Using scripts or tools such as Docker or Podman to deploy malicious payloads.
- Employing legitimate credentials stored within the environment for authentication.

Adversary Emulation Details:
- Sample Commands: `docker run -d --name malicious_container <image>`, `kubectl create deployment --image=<malicious_image>`
- Test Scenarios: Deploy a benign container mimicking adversarial behavior to test detection capabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may be less effective in highly dynamic or complex container environments with frequent legitimate changes. Encrypted traffic analysis is limited without appropriate decryption capabilities.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes baseline behaviors are well-understood, and monitoring systems are correctly configured to detect anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate updates or patches applied via containers.
- Routine deployments during maintenance windows.
- Authorized changes by users with valid access permissions.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Containers provide a scalable and flexible environment for deploying applications, making them attractive targets for adversaries. The ability to bypass security monitoring through containers can lead to significant breaches, data exfiltration, or persistent threats within an organization's infrastructure.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Validate the nature of the container activity by cross-referencing logs and network traffic.
2. **Isolation:** Temporarily isolate affected containers to prevent potential spread or escalation.
3. **Credential Review:** Examine account usage patterns for signs of compromised credentials.
4. **Remediation:** Address any identified vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or unauthorized activities.
5. **Documentation:** Record findings and actions taken for future reference and continuous improvement.
