## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages endpoint monitoring tools to capture and analyze events related to window creation and manipulation. The primary data sources include process event logs and API calls that create or modify windows. Patterns analyzed involve the use of APIs such as `CreateWindowEx` with flags set for hidden visibility, indicating potential malicious activity.

---

## Technical Context
Adversaries commonly employ this technique by executing scripts or programs that create windows with styles configured to be invisible, thus evading standard user interface monitoring tools. This tactic is often used in malware to perform actions without alerting the victim.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - On Windows, attackers might use PowerShell commands such as `Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden` or direct API calls like `CreateWindowEx(... , SW_HIDE)`.
  
- **Test Scenarios:** 
  - Create a hidden window using command-line tools and verify its absence from normal user interface scans.

---

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection might miss sophisticated variants that manipulate additional properties to further obscure their presence.
  - Limited visibility into environments with restricted logging or telemetry collection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes consistent endpoint monitoring configurations across environments for accurate detection.
  - Relies on logs being intact and accessible without tampering.

---

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate applications using hidden windows, such as background services or system utilities (e.g., antivirus software).
- Development tools that employ hidden interfaces during testing or debugging sessions.

---

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification:
- While the technique is a common defense evasion tactic, its use by sophisticated adversaries necessitates attention.
- The potential impact of undetected hidden windows could compromise sensitive operations or data, making this a priority for environments with high-security requirements.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Hidden Window:**
   - On Windows:
     1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
     2. Execute `Start-Process notepad.exe -WindowStyle Hidden`.
     3. Verify that the process is running but no window appears.

2. **Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin:**
   - Install a headless browser such as Puppeteer or Selenium.
   - Configure it to launch a browser instance without a visible window.
   - Direct the browser to access a mock endpoint (e.g., `https://mockbin.com/request`) and capture logs of network activity.

3. **Hidden Window-Conhost Execution:**
   - Use command prompt with hidden execution:
     1. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
     2. Execute `cmd /c start "" /b cmd.exe`.
     3. Ensure no visible window appears but the process is running in the background.

## Response
When an alert indicating a hidden window technique fires, analysts should:

- Verify if the originating process or user context has legitimate reasons for creating hidden windows.
- Examine related logs and network activity for signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration attempts.
- Isolate affected systems to prevent potential spread or further compromise.
- Initiate incident response protocols based on organizational policy.
