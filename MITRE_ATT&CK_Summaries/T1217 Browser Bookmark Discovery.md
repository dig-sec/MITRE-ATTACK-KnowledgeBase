# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Browser Bookmarks

## **Goal**
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting browser bookmarks and related files.

## **Categorization**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1217 - Browser Bookmark Discovery
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1217)

## **Strategy Abstract**
The detection strategy involves monitoring for unauthorized access and manipulation of browser bookmark files across multiple platforms. Data sources include file system logs, process creation events, and user activity logs. Patterns analyzed include unexpected changes to bookmark files, unauthorized access attempts, or the presence of scripts designed to manipulate these files.

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries may use browser bookmarks as a vector for persistence, data exfiltration, or communication with command-and-control servers. By altering bookmarks, they can store malicious URLs or even execute code through certain vulnerabilities in browsers.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

- **Linux/macOS:** Adversaries might list or modify Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome bookmark database files to insert or retrieve data.
- **Windows:** Techniques may involve accessing Internet Explorer, Edge Chromium, and Firefox bookmarks via command-line tools like PowerShell or CMD to exploit similar vulnerabilities.

Sample Commands for Emulation:
- **Firefox Bookmarks on Linux/FreeBSD:**
  ```bash
  ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default*/bookmarkbackups/
  ```
- **Chrome Bookmarks on macOS:**
  ```bash
  defaults read ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks
  ```

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- **Blind Spots:** The strategy may not detect bookmark manipulation if done through remote scripts or APIs that do not leave local traces.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that all relevant user profiles are monitored, which might miss isolated accounts with restricted access.

## **False Positives**
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate users updating bookmarks frequently for personal use.
- Automated system processes that manage or clean up bookmark files as part of regular maintenance.

## **Priority**
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While not immediately critical, the exploitation of browser bookmarks can lead to persistent access and data exfiltration if left undetected. The potential impact on sensitive information makes this a medium-priority threat.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**
### Instructions:
1. **List Mozilla Firefox Bookmark Database Files:**
   - **FreeBSD/Linux:** 
     ```bash
     ls ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default*/bookmarkbackups/
     ```
   - **macOS:**
     ```bash
     ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox/Profiles/*/bookmarks*
     ```

2. **List Google Chrome Bookmark JSON Files:**
   - **macOS:**
     ```bash
     defaults read ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks
     ```

3. **Windows (Various Browsers):**
   - **PowerShell for Chrome/Opera/Edge:**
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem "$env:APPDATA\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\*\Custom Tabs Session" -Recurse
     ```
   - **CMD for Edge Chromium:**
     ```cmd
     dir %LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AC\MicrosoftEdge\Cache\
     ```

4. **List Mozilla Firefox Bookmarks on Windows:**
   ```cmd
   dir %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*\places.sqlite
   ```

5. **Internet Explorer Bookmarks:**
   ```cmd
   dir %USERPROFILE%\Favorites\
   ```

6. **Safari Bookmarks on macOS:**
   - Use Terminal:
     ```bash
     defaults read ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist
     ```

7. **Extract Browsing History:**
   - **Edge Browsing History:**
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem "$env:APPDATA\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\History" -Recurse
     ```
   - **Chrome Browsing History:**
     ```bash
     sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History "SELECT * FROM urls;"
     ```

## **Response**
When an alert is triggered:
- Verify the legitimacy of bookmark file access or modification.
- Check for concurrent suspicious activity such as lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
- Isolate affected systems and review recent changes to browser settings or profiles.

- Suspicious Where Execution  
  Further context can be obtained by reviewing logs for unusual `dir` command usage which may indicate an adversary's attempt to enumerate files.
