# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using logon scripts on macOS systems. By identifying and analyzing suspicious activities related to script execution during user logons, we aim to uncover potential persistence or privilege escalation tactics employed by adversaries.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages various data sources such as system logs, user activity monitoring, and script execution history to identify anomalous patterns indicative of adversarial logon scripts. Key patterns include the execution of unrecognized or unauthorized scripts during user login processes, unusual modifications in script files, and unexpected changes to scheduled tasks or launch agents.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit macOS's built-in scripting capabilities to maintain persistence or escalate privileges by automating malicious activities upon user logon. Common methods involve placing a malicious script within startup directories or modifying existing scripts to execute harmful actions when users log in. 

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - Adversaries might use commands like `echo "malicious_command" >> ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.launch.plist` to modify launch agents.
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Create a benign script that mimics adversarial behavior for testing purposes and observe its execution during login.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection assumes logon scripts are executed locally; remote execution might not trigger alerts as effectively.
- The strategy may miss obfuscated scripts that evade signature-based detection.
- Assumes comprehensive logging of user actions and script executions is enabled on the system.

## False Positives
- Legitimate administrative tasks that involve scheduled scripts or automated maintenance processes during logon might trigger false positives.
- Users with administrative rights running benign custom scripts as part of their workflow can be misidentified as threats.

## Priority
**Priority Level: Medium**

Justification:
- While not the most common method, adversaries do use logon scripts for persistence and privilege escalation, making it a significant threat that requires attention. The technique's potential to bypass security measures warrants medium priority due to its impact on system integrity and data confidentiality.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions to Emulate Logon Script in a Test Environment

1. **Prepare the Test Environment:**
   - Ensure you have administrative access to a macOS test machine.
   - Enable logging for script executions via `syslog` or other system monitoring tools.

2. **Create a Sample Logon Script:**
   - Open Terminal and navigate to `/Users/username/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
   - Create a new plist file (e.g., `com.test.logonscript.plist`) using:
     ```bash
     nano com.test.logonscript.plist
     ```

3. **Define the Script Content:**
   - Insert the following XML content into the plist file:
     ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
     <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
         <key>Label</key>
         <string>com.test.logonscript</string>
         <key>ProgramArguments</key>
         <array>
             <string>/bin/sh</string>
             <string>-c</string>
             <string>echo "Logon script executed"</string>
         </array>
         <key>RunAtLoad</key>
         <true/>
     </dict>
     </plist>
     ```

4. **Set Permissions and Load the Script:**
   - Save and exit nano, then set appropriate permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod 644 com.test.logonscript.plist
     ```
   - Register the script using:
     ```bash
     launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.test.logonscript.plist
     ```

5. **Test Execution:**
   - Log out and log back in to trigger the script.
   - Verify execution by checking system logs for the output "Logon script executed."

## Response
When an alert related to unauthorized or suspicious logon scripts fires:
- **Immediate Actions:** 
  - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further compromise.
  - Review and analyze log entries associated with the script execution for indicators of compromise (IoCs).
  
- **Investigation Steps:**
  - Identify all instances where logon scripts are deployed or modified across affected systems.
  - Determine if any data exfiltration or unauthorized access occurred during script execution.

- **Remediation Actions:**
  - Remove or disable unauthorized logon scripts from the system.
  - Revert any changes made by suspicious scripts and restore system integrity.
  
- **Post-Incident Review:**
  - Assess current detection capabilities for improvement opportunities.
  - Update security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.
