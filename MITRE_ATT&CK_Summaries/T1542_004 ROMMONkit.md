# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: ROMMONkit Detection

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging ROMMON mode in network devices, which can be indicative of a persistent threat on the network infrastructure.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1542.004 - ROMMONkit
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Network

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalies in network traffic and device behavior that may indicate an adversary has accessed ROMMON mode. The primary data sources include:
- **Network Traffic Logs:** Monitoring for unusual traffic patterns or connections to known malicious IP addresses.
- **Device Log Files:** Analysis of router/switch logs for unexpected command execution, especially those indicative of a boot into ROMMON mode.

Patterns analyzed include unauthorized access attempts during device reboots and suspicious network management protocol activity. Anomalies in these areas suggest potential exploitation of vulnerabilities leading to persistence through ROMMONkit techniques.

## Technical Context
Adversaries execute this technique by exploiting vulnerabilities that allow them to gain control over a device's boot process, specifically targeting the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) mode on Cisco devices. Once an attacker gains access, they can modify configurations or load malicious firmware, which allows for persistence even after a reboot.

Real-world execution may involve:
- Exploiting known CVEs in networking equipment.
- Using default credentials or previously obtained administrative privileges to initiate a manual boot into ROMMON mode.

Adversary emulation might include commands like `boot system flash:<malicious_image>` executed during device startup, indicating the presence of malicious firmware.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** The detection strategy may not identify attacks if they occur through zero-day vulnerabilities or sophisticated evasion techniques.
- **Assumption:** It is assumed that monitoring tools have full visibility into network traffic and device logs, which may not always be the case in segmented networks.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative access to ROMMON mode for maintenance purposes.
- Network misconfigurations causing unexpected reboots or changes in traffic patterns.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
The ability of an adversary to persist through network infrastructure devices can lead to long-term undetected presence, enabling further lateral movement and data exfiltration. Given the critical role of network devices in organizational operations, any compromise poses a significant threat.

## Response
When an alert indicating possible ROMMONkit activity fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify Alert Validity:** Confirm if there was legitimate administrative access to ROMMON mode around the time of the alert.
2. **Investigate Network Logs:** Review network traffic and device logs for signs of unauthorized access or command execution.
3. **Isolate Affected Devices:** Temporarily isolate any devices showing suspicious activity to prevent potential spread.
4. **Patch Vulnerabilities:** Ensure all firmware and software on affected devices are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
5. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis:** Perform a detailed forensic examination of the device to identify changes made during ROMMON mode access.
