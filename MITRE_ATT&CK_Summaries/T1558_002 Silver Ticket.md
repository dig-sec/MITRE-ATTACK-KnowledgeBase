# Detection Strategy: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Silver Tickets

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing **Silver Tickets** within a Windows environment. These tickets allow adversaries to impersonate any user in an Active Directory domain, potentially leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1558.002 - Silver Ticket
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous behaviors and artifacts associated with the use of Silver Tickets. Key data sources include:

- Active Directory (AD) logs for unusual ticket usage patterns.
- Security Event Logs for Kerberos authentication anomalies.
- Network traffic analysis to detect unexpected or unauthorized access attempts.

Patterns analyzed involve detecting inconsistencies in ticket issuance, such as tickets not originating from a legitimate Kerberos KDC and abnormal permissions granted.

## Technical Context
Silver Tickets are forged Kerberos authentication tickets that allow an attacker to bypass normal authentication processes. Attackers typically use tools like **mimikatz** to generate these tickets by exploiting weaknesses in Active Directory configurations or using previously obtained credentials.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In practice, adversaries might execute the following steps:
1. Use mimikatz to extract a hash of an account with sufficient permissions.
2. Craft a Silver Ticket targeting specific services (e.g., SMB, LDAP).

Sample command for crafting a Silver Ticket:

```bash
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::golden /user:Administrator /domain:TARGETDOMAIN /sid:S-1-5-21-... /krbtgt:HMACSHA1-HASH /service:cifs /ptt"
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** Active Directory logs are properly configured and retained.
- **Blind Spot:** Detection might miss sophisticated adversaries who mask their activities to resemble legitimate ticket usage.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks using tools like mimikatz for password resets.
- Misconfigured automated scripts that inadvertently generate anomalous ticket patterns.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Silver Tickets allow adversaries significant access and control over domain resources, posing a severe threat to organizational security. The potential impact of undetected use justifies prioritizing this detection strategy.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate the technique in a test environment:

1. **Setup:** Establish a controlled Windows domain with an Active Directory server.
2. **Tool Installation:** Install mimikatz on a test machine within the domain.
3. **Hash Extraction:**
   - Use `lsadump::dcsync /user:Administrator` to obtain NTLM hashes from the Domain Controller Service Account (krbtgt).
4. **Silver Ticket Creation:**
   - Execute the command provided above with appropriate values for TARGETDOMAIN, S-1-5-21..., and HMACSHA1-HASH.
5. **Observation:** Monitor AD logs and security events to identify any anomalies indicative of Silver Ticket usage.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:

1. **Verify Alert Validity:**
   - Cross-reference with recent administrative activities or known scripts that may legitimately generate similar patterns.
2. **Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into the context and origin of the suspicious ticket issuance.
3. **Containment and Mitigation:**
   - Disable compromised accounts immediately and revoke any forged tickets if possible.
4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Analyze how the attack was conducted, evaluate existing security measures, and update policies to prevent recurrence.
