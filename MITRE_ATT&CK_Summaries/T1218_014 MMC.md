# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using MMC (Microsoft Management Console)

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-ins, specifically focusing on the "Event Log" and "Services" snap-ins. By leveraging these tools, adversaries can manipulate or conceal their activities from detection mechanisms.

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring the use of MMC to access or manipulate system components such as event logs and services. Key data sources include:

- **Process Monitoring:** Tracking processes that launch `mmc.exe` with suspicious snap-ins.
- **Event Logs:** Identifying unauthorized accesses or modifications in Windows Event Logs.
- **Service Manipulation Events:** Detecting changes to service configurations via MMC.

Patterns analyzed include unusual access patterns, elevated privileges without justification, and deviations from baseline activity profiles for user accounts and processes.

## Technical Context
Adversaries use MMC due to its deep integration into the Windows operating system, allowing them to manage critical components like event logs and services. By clearing or altering event logs, adversaries can obscure their activities. Similarly, modifying service configurations can disable security measures or enable persistence mechanisms.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Launching MMC with specific snap-ins:
    ```shell
    mmc.exe /s C:\path\to\custom_mmc.msc
    ```
  - Clearing event logs using the Event Log snap-in:
    ```powershell
    Wevtutil cl Application
    ```

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Monitoring for `mmc.exe` process executions with custom `.msc` files.
  - Detecting privilege escalations associated with MMC usage.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Legitimate administrative tasks using MMC may not be distinguishable from malicious activities without context.
  - Encrypted channels or obfuscated scripts used to launch MMC might evade detection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Baseline behavior profiles are accurately established for user and process activity.
  - Security systems have visibility into all relevant data sources, including logs and process executions.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate IT administrators using MMC for routine maintenance or troubleshooting.
- Scheduled tasks configured to clear event logs as part of a security policy.
- Software installation processes that utilize MMC for configuration purposes.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The ability to bypass monitoring by manipulating event logs and services poses a significant threat, allowing adversaries to maintain persistence and avoid detection. This can lead to extended periods of unauthorized access and data exfiltration.

## Response
When an alert fires:

1. **Verify Activity:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of `mmc.exe` execution and associated snap-ins.
   - Check for unusual privilege escalations or deviations from normal user behavior.

2. **Investigate Context:**
   - Review recent changes to event logs and services.
   - Correlate with other security events, such as network anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Contain and Mitigate:**
   - Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
   - Restore event logs from backups if tampered with.

4. **Report and Remediate:**
   - Document findings and update threat intelligence feeds.
   - Implement additional controls to prevent recurrence, such as stricter access policies or enhanced monitoring.
