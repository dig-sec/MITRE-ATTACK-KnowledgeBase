# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. Specifically, it targets techniques where adversaries exploit containerization features to obscure their command and control (C2) activities.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1104 - Multi-Stage Channels
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1104)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying abnormal container activities that may indicate adversarial C2 channels. Key data sources include:
- Container runtime logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Network traffic associated with containers
- System process activity within containerized environments

Patterns analyzed involve unusual network connections originating from or targeting containers, unexpected lifecycle events of containers (creation, deletion), and atypical inter-container communication patterns.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may leverage containers to create isolated environments that bypass traditional security controls. They often exploit the dynamic nature of container ecosystems to deploy C2 servers within ephemeral containers, making detection challenging.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries use tools like `kubectl` or Docker CLI commands to manage these operations stealthily:
- Starting a malicious container with hidden processes.
- Using encrypted channels for communication between containers and external C2 servers.

Adversary emulation details involve setting up test environments where attackers deploy known malware within containers and establish covert communications using legitimate-looking network traffic.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss highly sophisticated techniques that mimic normal container behavior closely. Additionally, if adversaries use advanced obfuscation methods like custom encryption protocols or steganography.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes a baseline of "normal" container activity is established for anomaly detection to be effective.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate development and testing environments using containers frequently.
- Normal inter-container communication in microservices architectures.
- Network traffic from trusted IP ranges or internal infrastructure that resembles adversarial patterns.

To mitigate false positives, contextual information like user roles, time of activity, and network geolocation can be integrated into the detection logic.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
- Containers are increasingly used in modern IT environments, making them attractive targets for adversaries.
- Successful exploitation could lead to significant data breaches or system compromise without detection.
- The ability to bypass traditional monitoring mechanisms amplifies potential impact.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected containers and examine their logs for suspicious activities.
   - Analyze network traffic patterns associated with the container(s) in question.

2. **Cross-Reference Activity:**
   - Compare detected activities against known threat intelligence and internal baselines to assess credibility.

3. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - If malicious activity is confirmed, terminate the suspicious containers.
   - Remove any associated resources or data that might have been compromised.

4. **Post-Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of how the detection occurred and refine rules to reduce false positives.
   - Update security policies and container management practices to prevent future occurrences.

## Additional Resources
No additional references are available at this time. Analysts should consider consulting broader threat intelligence feeds, community forums, and vendor-specific documentation for more detailed insights into evolving adversary techniques within containerized environments.
