# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by reverting cloud instances to previous states using containers, specifically targeting the IaaS platform.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1578.004 - Revert Cloud Instance
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/004)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring cloud infrastructure for unusual reversion activities that indicate adversarial attempts to bypass security controls. The primary data sources include:
- Cloud provider logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Log)
- Container orchestration system logs (e.g., Kubernetes Audit Logs)

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual or unauthorized creation of snapshots
- Restoration of instances from older or unexpected snapshots
- Anomalous API calls related to instance management and snapshot operations

## Technical Context
Adversaries executing this technique aim to revert cloud instances to a known state where their malicious activities are hidden or obfuscated. This can be achieved by creating and managing snapshots, which allow them to restore the environment to a previous point in time.

### Real-World Execution
In practice, adversaries may:
1. Create snapshots of compromised instances containing sensitive data.
2. Restore these snapshots to revert changes made during security investigations or audits.
3. Execute malicious payloads once the instance is reverted to a state before detection.

### Adversary Emulation Details
While specific command samples are not provided due to ethical considerations, test scenarios might include:
- Unauthorized snapshot creation using cloud provider CLI tools (e.g., `aws ec2 create-snapshot`)
- Instance restoration from snapshots through orchestration commands or API requests

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** The strategy may not detect stealthy or well-disguised reversion activities that mimic legitimate administrative tasks.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that snapshot creation and instance management are logged accurately by the cloud provider.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative actions to revert instances for maintenance or rollback purposes.
- Automated backup processes creating snapshots as part of routine operations.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to revert an instance to a previous state can significantly undermine incident response efforts, allowing adversaries to persist and maintain access undetected. This technique poses a substantial risk to organizational security posture and data integrity.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions for emulating this technique in a test environment are not available due to the potential risks involved. However, organizations can conduct controlled tests with proper authorization to validate detection capabilities.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential instance reversion is triggered:
1. **Verify Activity:** Confirm whether the snapshot creation or restoration was authorized.
2. **Analyze Context:** Review logs and metadata for unusual patterns or timings that suggest malicious intent.
3. **Containment:** If malicious activity is confirmed, isolate affected instances to prevent further compromise.
4. **Investigate:** Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the scope of the reversion and its impact on security posture.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are not available at this time. Organizations should consult their cloud provider's documentation and security best practices for further guidance.
