# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging containerization technologies. Specifically, the focus is on detecting when attackers use containers to obscure their activities from traditional monitoring tools.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy utilizes a combination of network traffic analysis and host-based monitoring to identify anomalies associated with the use of containers as evasion tools. Key data sources include:

- **Container Orchestrator Logs:** Observing unexpected or unauthorized container deployments.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring for unusual patterns in network communication that may indicate hidden processes within containers.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detecting changes to system files and configurations that are common when setting up evasion environments.

The strategy focuses on identifying:

- Unusual spikes in resource utilization indicative of container activity.
- Network communications from typically non-networked services.
- Unauthorized modifications to container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may execute this technique by setting up containers with minimal logging, using them to host malicious payloads, and routing sensitive traffic through these containers to avoid detection. This can include:

- Running processes that mimic legitimate ones but perform malicious activities.
- Using container escape techniques to gain access to the underlying host system.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique in a test environment, consider:

1. **Deploying Containers:** Use Docker or Kubernetes to set up unauthorized containers running services with minimal logging enabled.
2. **Network Traffic Redirection:** Configure network rules within these containers to reroute traffic through external malicious endpoints.
3. **Host Resource Utilization:** Generate high resource usage reports by executing intensive processes within the container, mimicking legitimate yet suspicious activity.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Advanced evasion techniques may still bypass detection if containers are configured with sophisticated logging suppression.
  - Zero-day vulnerabilities in container platforms could be exploited to evade detection mechanisms.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Security tools have access to all relevant logs from the container orchestration platforms and network traffic.
  - Baseline behavior is well-understood, allowing for effective anomaly detection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers in development environments where temporary or experimental services are deployed with minimal logging.
- Normal spikes in resource utilization due to legitimate workloads during peak business hours.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability for attackers to bypass security monitoring using containers represents a significant threat. This technique can lead to undetected persistence, data exfiltration, and lateral movement within a network, making it imperative to detect and mitigate promptly.

## Response

When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Alert Validity:** Confirm whether the detected activity is legitimate or malicious by examining the context of container deployments and associated network traffic.
2. **Isolate Suspicious Containers:** Quarantine containers identified as suspicious to prevent further potential damage.
3. **Investigate Network Traffic:** Analyze outbound connections for signs of data exfiltration or command and control (C2) communications.
4. **Review System Logs:** Cross-reference with host and network logs to identify any additional indicators of compromise (IoCs).
