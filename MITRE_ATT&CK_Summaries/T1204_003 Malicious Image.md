# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containers as a means of executing malicious payloads.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1204.003 - Malicious Image
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** IaaS, Containers
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/003)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying malicious activities related to the use of containers. Key data sources include container runtime logs, network traffic, and file system changes. Patterns analyzed involve anomalous image pulls, unexpected process execution within containers, and irregular network communications associated with containerized environments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containers by embedding malicious payloads into Docker images or Kubernetes manifests to execute code on cloud infrastructure (IaaS) unnoticed. They might use legitimate-looking container images or modify existing ones to bypass security measures. This can be executed through commands like:

- Building and running a Docker image with embedded malware:
  ```bash
  docker build -t malicious-image .
  docker run --rm malicious-image
  ```
  
- Deploying malicious Kubernetes manifests:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: malicious-deployment
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: mal_container
          image: malicious-image
          command: ["sh", "-c", "malicious_command"]
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss obfuscated payloads within container images or rely heavily on signature-based detection, missing zero-day threats.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that baseline behaviors of containers are well-defined and any deviation is potentially malicious.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate updates to container images or deployments.
- Scheduled maintenance scripts executed in containers for system health checks.
- Developers testing new functionalities within isolated environments.

## Priority
**Severity: High**
This technique poses a high severity risk due to the potential for adversaries to execute sophisticated attacks with minimal detection, leveraging containerized environments to conceal malicious activities effectively.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Deploy Docker and Kubernetes on an isolated testing machine.
   
2. **Create Malicious Docker Image:**
   ```bash
   FROM ubuntu:latest
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
   CMD ["curl", "-s", "http://malicious.example.com"]
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t malicious-image .
   docker run --rm malicious-image
   ```
   
4. **Deploy Malicious Kubernetes Manifest:**
   - Save the above manifest as `malicious-deployment.yaml`.
   - Apply using: 
     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f malicious-deployment.yaml
     ```

5. **Monitor Logs and Network Traffic:**
   - Capture logs from Docker runtime and network interfaces.
   - Analyze for anomalous activity patterns.

## Response
When an alert related to this technique fires, analysts should:
- Isolate the affected containers or hosts immediately.
- Review container runtime logs and network traffic for malicious activities.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the involved images and deployments.
- Update detection rules based on findings to reduce future false positives.
