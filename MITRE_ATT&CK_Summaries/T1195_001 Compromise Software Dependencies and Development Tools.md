# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to compromise software dependencies and development tools, specifically by exploiting vulnerabilities in these components.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1195.001 - Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools.
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Initial Access.
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows.

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring software supply chains and development environments for signs of compromise. Key data sources include:
- Package manager logs (e.g., npm, pip)
- Source control systems (e.g., Git)
- Build system logs

Patterns analyzed involve unexpected changes in dependencies or versions, unauthorized commits to repositories, and anomalies in build scripts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in software development tools by injecting malicious code into open-source libraries or manipulating dependency versions. In real-world scenarios, this can occur through compromised package managers or insider threats within a development team.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Malicious update of a library version:
    ```bash
    npm install vulnerable-library@1.2.3-malicious
    ```
  - Unauthorized commit to repository:
    ```bash
    git commit -am "Add malicious code"
    ```

### Test Scenarios
- Inject malicious code into an open-source project and observe detection systems.
- Simulate unauthorized version updates in package dependencies.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection relies on the assumption that changes to dependencies are logged accurately.
- May not detect sophisticated attacks that avoid logging or use obfuscated commands.
- Assumes that all build environments are consistently monitored.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate updates or patches applied by developers.
- Automated scripts performing routine maintenance tasks.
- Misconfigurations in version control settings leading to unexpected commit behaviors.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
Justification: Compromise of software dependencies can lead to widespread exploitation across multiple systems and organizations, making it a critical threat vector.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify the authenticity of the changes detected.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected environments to prevent further spread.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify how the compromise occurred and assess the extent of impact.
4. **Remediation:** Remove malicious code, restore dependencies to known good states, and apply necessary patches.

## Additional Resources
- None available
