# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers on Linux and macOS platforms, specifically through the misuse of SSH as a means for lateral movement.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1021.004 - SSH
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages log data from system and network sources to identify unusual SSH activity indicative of lateral movement via containers. This includes monitoring:
- SSH login attempts originating from unexpected internal addresses.
- Anomalous patterns in container usage, such as creation or execution of containers with elevated privileges.
- Correlations between container activities and SSH logs for signs of bypassing traditional security measures.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit containers to establish persistence and move laterally within a network by:
- Configuring containers to execute commands that initiate SSH sessions.
- Using compromised credentials to gain unauthorized access.
Real-world scenarios involve adversaries setting up containers with tools like `Docker` or `Podman`, executing scripts, and leveraging them to bypass security controls through obfuscated SSH connections.

**Adversary Emulation Example:**
1. Launch a container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm <image_name>
   ```
2. Inside the container, establish an SSH connection:
   ```bash
   ssh user@target_ip
   ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not capture all methods of obfuscation used in containers.
  - Encrypted traffic can obscure detection patterns.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Containers are configured to log activities consistently.
  - Network telemetry is available for comprehensive analysis.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of SSH by system administrators for maintenance tasks.
- Routine container operations in development environments where testing involves lateral movement simulations.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant threat due to the potential for undetected lateral movement, persistence, and subsequent exploitation within an organizationâ€™s network. Addressing this technique is crucial to maintaining robust defense mechanisms against sophisticated attacks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Enable SSH via PowerCLI:**
   - Connect to the ESXi host.
     ```bash
     Connect-VIServer <esxi_host>
     ```
   - Enable SSH:
     ```powershell
     Get-VMHostService | Where-Object {$_.Key -eq "TSM-SSH"} | Set-VMHostService -Policy "On"
     ```

2. **Enable SSH via VIM-CMD:**
   - Connect to the ESXi host using Vim-cmd:
     ```bash
     vim-cmd server.connect <esxi_host>
     ```
   - Enable SSH service:
     ```bash
     vim-cmd hostsvc/start/Service.TSM-SSH
     ```

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Review SSH logs for unusual login attempts.
   - Inspect container activity logs to identify unauthorized operations.

2. **Containment Measures:**
   - Isolate the affected containers and hosts to prevent further lateral movement.
   - Revoke compromised credentials and enforce stricter access controls.

3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Determine how adversaries gained access or bypassed existing security measures.
   - Update detection rules based on new findings to enhance monitoring capabilities.
