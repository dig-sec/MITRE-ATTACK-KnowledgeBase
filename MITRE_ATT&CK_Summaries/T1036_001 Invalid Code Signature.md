# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing containers with invalid code signatures.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1036.001 - Invalid Code Signature
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** macOS, Windows

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/001)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages data sources including container runtime logs and application execution metadata. It focuses on analyzing patterns related to invalid code signatures that adversaries might exploit to evade detection systems.

Key elements include:
- Monitoring for containers executing with unsigned or improperly signed binaries.
- Detecting discrepancies in expected digital signature attributes.
- Analyzing the execution context of containerized applications for anomalies indicative of evasion attempts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may deploy this technique by crafting malicious executables that lack valid signatures, allowing them to run within a container environment without triggering alerts from traditional security monitoring tools. In practice, they might:
- Use containers as ephemeral environments to execute payloads.
- Employ obfuscation techniques on code signatures to slip past signature verification checks.

### Adversary Emulation Details
While detailed commands for adversary emulation are not provided here, common steps include:
1. Compiling a malicious application without signing it or using an invalid certificate.
2. Deploying this application within a containerized environment.
3. Testing the deployment in environments with typical signature-based detection mechanisms to verify evasion success.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** Detection systems have visibility into all container runtime activities and can access relevant metadata for analysis.
- **Limitations:**
  - If an adversary uses advanced techniques to mimic legitimate signing processes, the strategy might miss such threats.
  - This approach assumes that all containers are monitored consistently across different platforms.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate applications running in containerized environments that have not been signed due to internal policy exemptions or oversight.
- Development and testing environments where unsigned binaries might be used temporarily during the build process.

## Priority
The severity of this detection strategy is assessed as **High**. The ability for adversaries to bypass security controls by using invalid code signatures within containers poses a significant threat, potentially allowing malicious activities to go undetected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
- None available

## Response
When an alert related to invalid code signatures in container environments fires:
1. **Immediate Analysis:** Examine the context and attributes of the flagged binary, including its origin, intended function, and execution environment.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent potential spread or further malicious activities.
3. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into how the invalid signature was able to bypass existing security measures.
4. **Mitigation:** Update detection rules to better identify similar attempts in the future and ensure all code signatures are validated appropriately.

This report outlines a comprehensive strategy for detecting adversarial use of containers with invalid code signatures, emphasizing both technical and strategic considerations within Palantir's ADS framework.
