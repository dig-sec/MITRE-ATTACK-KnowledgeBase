# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to exploit executable installer file permissions weaknesses on Windows systems for persistence, privilege escalation, and defense evasion.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1574.005 - Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** 
  - Persistence
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages data sources such as file system logs, event logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs), and process monitoring tools. It analyzes patterns indicative of permission weaknesses exploitation, specifically focusing on the modification or misuse of permissions for executable installer files that can lead to unauthorized execution.

Key indicators include:
- Unexpected changes in file permissions of installer executables.
- Execution of known malicious executables with elevated privileges without proper authorization.
- Anomalies in event logs corresponding to unusual installer activity from non-standard locations.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit this technique by leveraging existing vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in executable installer files, which allow them to execute code with elevated privileges. They often modify file permissions to bypass security controls, facilitating persistence and privilege escalation.

### Real-World Execution:
Adversaries might use commands such as `icacls` on Windows to alter file permissions and gain unauthorized access. For example:

```shell
icacls "C:\path\to\installer.exe" /grant Everyone:F /T
```

This command grants full control of an executable installer file to all users, including those without administrative privileges.

### Adversary Emulation:
In a controlled test environment, emulate this technique by adjusting permissions of a benign installer and executing it with various user roles. This helps in observing the system's response and validating detection mechanisms.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Assumption:** The monitoring systems have comprehensive logging enabled for file permission changes.
- **Blind Spot:** Detection may not identify highly sophisticated evasion techniques that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities or use advanced obfuscation methods to avoid detection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate IT operations involving bulk updates of software installers with new permissions settings.
- Automated deployment scripts configured by system administrators for maintenance purposes.
- Regular user actions on systems where users have been granted administrative rights.

These scenarios can lead to changes in file permissions and executable behaviors that resemble adversarial activity.

## Priority

**Severity: Medium**

Justification:
- The technique is a common method used by adversaries but relies on existing misconfigurations, which may already be mitigated by robust security policies.
- While the potential impact of such exploitation can be significant (e.g., unauthorized system access), it typically requires pre-existing vulnerabilities or lax security practices.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Steps to Emulate in a Test Environment:

1. **Prepare Test Environment:**
   - Set up a Windows machine with logging enabled for file permissions and process execution.
   
2. **Select Target File:**
   - Choose a benign executable installer, ensuring it is initially configured with standard user permissions.

3. **Modify Permissions:**
   - Use `icacls` to change the permissions of the selected executable:
     ```shell
     icacls "C:\path\to\installer.exe" /grant Everyone:F /T
     ```

4. **Execute File:**
   - Attempt to execute the installer using a non-administrative user account.

5. **Monitor and Log Activities:**
   - Observe changes in file permissions, execution logs, and any alerts triggered by monitoring tools.

6. **Analyze Results:**
   - Validate that the detection systems identify and log the suspicious activity accurately.

## Response

When an alert triggers:
1. **Immediate Analysis:** Examine logs to confirm if the change was authorized or malicious.
2. **Containment:** If deemed malicious, restrict access to the affected system to prevent further exploitation.
3. **Remediation:** Revert file permissions to their original state and remove any unauthorized changes made by the executable.
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigate how the permission change occurred to strengthen security policies and mitigate future risks.
