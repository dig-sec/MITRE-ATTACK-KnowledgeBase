# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detecting Adversarial Ptrace System Calls on Linux

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging `ptrace` system calls on Linux systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring `ptrace` system calls to identify suspicious activities. Key data sources include audit logs and security information and event management (SIEM) systems that capture these syscall events. The strategy analyzes patterns such as:
- Unusual frequency of `ptrace` usage.
- Execution by non-root users, particularly in sensitive directories or processes.
- Correlation with other known evasion techniques.

## Technical Context
Adversaries use `ptrace` for several purposes: debugging applications, reading process memory, and manipulating execution states. By attaching to legitimate processes, they can evade detection mechanisms and escalate privileges through code injection or information exfiltration.

### Adversary Emulation Details
To emulate this technique:
1. **Sample Command:** An adversary might use `gdb` to attach to a running process:  
   ```
   gdb -p <PID>
   ```
2. **Test Scenario:** In a controlled environment, observe the behavior of processes when a non-privileged user issues `ptrace`. This can reveal how legitimate debugging tools are being abused.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Encrypted or obfuscated payloads may not be directly detectable.
  - Legitimate use cases of `ptrace` by system administrators might be misclassified as malicious.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The presence of detailed audit logging is assumed.
  - System configurations allow for the capture and analysis of syscall events.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate debugging or testing operations performed by system administrators.
- Development environments where `ptrace` is commonly used as a standard tool.

## Priority
**High:** Given its potential use in privilege escalation and evasion, detecting malicious `ptrace` usage is critical. The high priority reflects the risk of bypassing security controls without detection.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Verification:**
   - Confirm if the user initiating `ptrace` has valid reasons.
   - Check the process being traced for any signs of compromise or unusual behavior.

2. **Containment:**
   - Temporarily restrict or disable `ptrace` capabilities for non-privileged users.
   - Isolate affected systems to prevent potential lateral movement.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of related logs and activities around the time of detection.
   - Assess whether other evasion techniques are in use.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Patch any vulnerabilities that allowed privilege escalation via `ptrace`.
   - Update security policies to better monitor and restrict syscall usage.
