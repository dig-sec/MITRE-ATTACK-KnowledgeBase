# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves identifying unauthorized container deployments and configurations that adversaries might use to obscure their activities from detection mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1583.003 - Virtual Private Server
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged, Remote Execution)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis and container orchestration logs to identify suspicious activities. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic:** Monitoring for unusual outbound connections that could indicate command-and-control (C2) communication.
- **Container Logs:** Analyzing container start-up scripts, runtime behavior, and configuration changes.
- **Orchestration Platform Logs:** Reviewing Kubernetes or Docker Swarm logs for unexpected pod deployments or resource allocation anomalies.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual patterns of resource usage that deviate from baseline activity.
- Containers attempting to communicate with known malicious IP addresses.
- Anomalies in container lifecycle events, such as rapid creation and deletion cycles.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to deploy malware, exfiltrate data, or establish persistence within a network. They might exploit misconfigurations in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to deploy unauthorized workloads.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --rm -d --name malicious_container <malicious_image>`
  - `kubectl create deployment --image=<malicious_image> <deployment_name>`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a container with network access to external domains.
  - Configure the container to execute scripts that attempt to connect to known C2 servers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection might miss containers that are configured to mimic legitimate traffic patterns.
  - Insider threats using authorized access could bypass detection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The baseline of normal activity is well-defined and regularly updated.
  - Security tools have full visibility into container orchestration platforms.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate testing environments deploying temporary containers.
- Routine updates or patches applied through orchestrated deployments.
- Authorized users experimenting with new configurations for development purposes.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The use of containers to bypass security monitoring poses a significant risk as it allows adversaries to operate under the radar. Containers can be rapidly deployed and scaled, making them an attractive option for attackers aiming to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data without detection.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should quickly assess the affected container's configuration and network activity.
2. **Containment:** Isolate the suspicious container from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine whether the anomaly is due to a misconfiguration, unauthorized access, or malicious intent.
4. **Remediation:** Remove any unauthorized containers and apply necessary security patches or configuration changes.
5. **Documentation:** Record the incident details for future reference and to improve detection strategies.
