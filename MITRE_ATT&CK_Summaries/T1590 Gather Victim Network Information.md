# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Pre-Execution)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy aims to identify unusual activities related to container deployments that may suggest attempts to evade security monitoring. Key data sources include network traffic logs, container runtime logs, and host system logs. Patterns such as unexpected spikes in container creation, abnormal network connections from containers, or the presence of known evasion tools within container images are analyzed to flag potential adversarial behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to bypass security monitoring due to their lightweight nature and ability to execute isolated environments quickly. In practice, attackers might deploy malicious containers that mimic legitimate services or processes to evade detection by traditional security systems.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- **Sample Commands:** Adversaries could use Docker commands like `docker run -d --name malicious_container <image>` to deploy a container with a potentially harmful payload.
- **Test Scenarios:** Simulate the deployment of containers that attempt to connect to unusual external IP addresses or execute scripts aimed at gathering network information.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all legitimate container activities are well-understood and baselined, which might not always be true in dynamic environments.
- May not detect sophisticated evasion techniques that mimic normal operational patterns precisely.
- Relies on the completeness and accuracy of collected logs from containers and host systems.

## False Positives
Potential false positives may include:
- Legitimate spikes in container usage due to business operations (e.g., during peak hours or special events).
- Containers deployed for legitimate but uncommon purposes, such as testing environments or temporary workloads.
- Network connections initiated by containers that are part of standard operational procedures.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring can significantly undermine an organization's defense posture. Early detection is crucial to prevent adversaries from gaining footholds and escalating their activities within the network.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm whether the detected activity aligns with known operational patterns or if it indicates a potential threat.
2. **Investigate Container Details:** Examine the container's image history, execution commands, and network connections to assess its intent.
3. **Contain the Threat:** If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate the affected container and remove it from the environment.
4. **Update Monitoring Rules:** Adjust detection rules to reduce false positives while maintaining sensitivity to potential threats.
