# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technology. The primary focus is on identifying and alerting on anomalous or malicious activities that suggest adversaries are using containers to evade detection mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1204 - User Execution
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS, IaaS, Containers

For more details on MITRE ATT&CK technique T1204, refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring a variety of data sources such as container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes or Docker), host system logs, network traffic, and user activity. The patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual creation and deployment of containers from non-standard locations.
- Containers running with elevated privileges without proper justification.
- Unexpected network communications originating from containerized applications.

By leveraging these data sources, the strategy aims to identify anomalies indicative of adversarial activities related to bypassing security monitoring using containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to hide their presence and movements within a network. They might execute malicious payloads within containers that are less scrutinized or leverage orchestration tools to automate attacks while evading traditional detection mechanisms.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --privileged -d my-malicious-image`
  - `kubectl apply -f ./suspicious-deployment.yaml`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a container with elevated privileges and monitor for unusual network traffic.
  - Use orchestration tools to rapidly deploy containers in an attempt to overwhelm detection capabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into encrypted communications within containers; inability to detect well-camouflaged payloads that mimic legitimate operations.
- **Assumptions:** It is assumed that all container activity should be logged accurately, and the baseline of "normal" behavior is well-defined.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for testing or development purposes with elevated privileges.
- Rapid deployment of containers as part of normal operational processes (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
- Network communications from containers used in non-malicious applications.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers represents a significant risk, potentially allowing adversaries to operate undetected within an environment. This can lead to data breaches, lateral movement, and further exploitation of resources.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
*None available*

While specific validation steps are not provided here, organizations should create custom adversary emulation scenarios based on their unique environments and threat models.

## Response
When an alert for this detection strategy fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm the legitimacy of the detected activity by examining logs and context.
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine if any sensitive data or systems have been compromised.
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further spread or damage.
4. **Investigation:** Analyze network traffic, user activities, and system changes related to the suspicious container.
5. **Remediation:** Remove malicious containers, restore affected systems, and apply necessary patches.
6. **Post-Incident Review:** Document findings and update detection rules and response procedures accordingly.

## Additional Resources
