# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Time Providers (MITRE ATT&CK T1547.003)

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify and mitigate adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by manipulating system time settings on Windows platforms. This technique, categorized under MITRE ATT&CK as T1547.003 - Time Providers, allows adversaries to establish persistence and perform privilege escalation by altering the perception of time within a compromised environment.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1547.003 - Time Providers
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources including system logs, process monitoring tools, and security event aggregators. By analyzing patterns such as unauthorized changes to time settings or unexpected creation of time providers, the strategy aims to detect adversarial behavior indicative of T1547.003.

Data sources include:
- Windows Event Logs (Event IDs related to system time changes)
- Process Activity Monitoring
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) logs

Key patterns analyzed involve unusual modifications in local or network-based time settings that deviate from established baselines.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute T1547.003 by leveraging administrative privileges to modify the system clock or create a custom time provider, effectively altering the timeline of events and potentially evading time-dependent security controls.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters /v RealTimeRegulation /t REG_DWORD /d 0`
  - `w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"time.nist.gov" /syncfromflags:MANUAL /reliable:YES /update`

### Test Scenarios:
1. Simulate an adversary creating a new time provider.
2. Emulate the process of editing an existing time provider to reflect a different network time source.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** The strategy may not detect sophisticated adversaries who manage to revert time changes without generating logs or leave no trace in monitored activities.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that baseline behavior includes typical administrative adjustments for time synchronization, which might not account for all legitimate use cases.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Routine network time protocol (NTP) updates initiated by system administrators.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks involving time synchronization checks or adjustments.

## Priority
**Severity Assessment:** High  
**Justification:** The ability to manipulate time can significantly impact security monitoring and incident response, allowing adversaries to obscure malicious activities. This technique directly affects the integrity of logs and timelines critical for forensic analysis.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate T1547.003 in a test environment:

1. **Create a New Time Provider:**
   - Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
   - Execute: `w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"time.nist.gov" /syncfromflags:MANUAL /reliable:YES /update`
   - Restart the Windows Time service using `net stop w32time` followed by `net start w32time`.

2. **Edit an Existing Time Provider:**
   - Access the registry editor (`regedit`) and navigate to:
     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters
     ```
   - Modify or add a new DWORD value for `RealTimeRegulation` to change its behavior.
   - Restart the Windows Time service as described above.

## Response
When an alert related to time provider manipulation fires, analysts should:
- Immediately verify the legitimacy of the time change by cross-referencing with known maintenance schedules and authorized personnel actions.
- Investigate the origin of the modification through logs, including who made changes and when.
- Temporarily isolate affected systems from network resources until further analysis is completed.
