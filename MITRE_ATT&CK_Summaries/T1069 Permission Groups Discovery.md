# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using container technologies. This includes identifying when adversaries exploit containers to conceal malicious activities, evade detection, and maintain persistence within an environment.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring container orchestration platforms and associated logs to identify suspicious activities that could indicate attempts to bypass security controls. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Analyze logs from Docker, Kubernetes, and other orchestrators for unusual patterns.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor network traffic between containers for anomalies or unauthorized communications.
- **Access Logs:** Evaluate permission changes in container environments to detect unauthorized access attempts.

Patterns analyzed will focus on:
- Sudden spikes in resource usage within specific containers
- Unusual communication paths between containers and external hosts
- Changes in container configurations that could indicate privilege escalation

## Technical Context

Adversaries use containers as a means of evading detection because they can encapsulate malicious payloads and execute them with minimal visibility to traditional security tools. In practice, adversaries might:

- Deploy malware within a container to exploit its isolated environment.
- Use containers to test network paths without alerting host-based intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
- Employ volume mounts or shared filesystems to access sensitive data stealthily.

**Sample Commands/Scenarios:**

- Adversaries may use commands like `docker exec` to interact with running containers and bypass security policies.
- Alter container resource limits to avoid detection by network monitoring tools.
  
## Blind Spots and Assumptions

### Known Limitations:
- **Dynamic Environments:** Highly dynamic or ephemeral environments can lead to high noise levels, complicating detection efforts.
- **Evasion Techniques:** Adversaries might use sophisticated evasion techniques that remain undetected, such as using legitimate container images with embedded payloads.

### Assumptions:
- The organization has a baseline understanding of normal container usage patterns.
- Monitoring tools are correctly configured and have access to all relevant logs.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate automated deployments or scaling operations in containers leading to spikes in resource usage.
- Authorized configuration changes by IT staff for maintenance or optimization purposes.
- Development teams deploying new features within isolated environments as part of their workflow.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

This technique poses a high risk because containers can obscure traditional monitoring mechanisms, allowing adversaries to maintain persistence and exfiltrate data undetected. The increasing adoption of containerized applications across industries amplifies the potential impact of such threats.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no step-by-step instructions are available for emulating this technique in a test environment. However, organizations can consider:

- Setting up isolated environments with standard container tools.
- Simulating typical adversary behaviors like unauthorized access or resource modification within containers to assess detection capabilities.

## Response

When an alert indicating potential adversarial activity is triggered:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected containers and restrict network access to prevent further compromise.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed examination of container logs, configurations, and any associated data to identify the scope of the breach.
3. **Threat Intelligence Correlation:** Compare findings with known threat intelligence feeds to understand adversary tactics and techniques.
4. **Revise Security Policies:** Update security policies and controls based on insights gained from the incident to prevent recurrence.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context for further study are not currently available, but organizations should regularly consult:
- Official documentation of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
- Industry threat intelligence reports focusing on emerging tactics involving containerized environments.
