# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. Specifically, it focuses on identifying when threat actors leverage containerized environments to obfuscate malicious activities and evade detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis, container monitoring logs, and behavioral analytics to identify patterns indicative of adversarial activities. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic Logs:** Analyze anomalies in traffic patterns within the container orchestration environment.
- **Container Runtime Logs:** Monitor for unusual activity such as unexpected image pulls or suspicious process executions.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Data:** Correlate endpoint behavior with network anomalies.

The strategy focuses on detecting deviations from baseline behaviors, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, abnormal inter-container communication, and atypical resource consumption patterns.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may use containers to bypass security controls due to their ephemeral nature and potential for rapid deployment. They exploit weaknesses in container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) by deploying malicious workloads or exploiting vulnerabilities within the container runtime environment. Common execution methods include:

- **Malicious Image Deployment:** Threat actors create or modify container images with embedded payloads.
- **Container Escape Attacks:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to break out of a container and gain access to the host system.

Adversary emulation details may involve commands such as `docker run` for deploying containers, coupled with network scanning tools like `nmap` to identify potential targets within the environment.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spot:** Detection strategies may not fully cover zero-day vulnerabilities in container orchestration platforms.
- **Assumption:** The baseline behavior established for normal operations is accurate and comprehensive, allowing for effective anomaly detection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate updates or deployments of new container images during regular maintenance windows.
- Authorized penetration testing activities mimicking adversarial behaviors.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant threat due to the criticality and scale at which these environments operate. Rapid detection is essential to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with standard configurations.
   - Ensure network logging tools are enabled, such as Sysdig or Falco.

2. **Simulate Adversarial Activity:**
   - Use `docker run` to deploy a container with known vulnerabilities (e.g., exploiting the `CVE-2019-5736` vulnerability).
   - Attempt an inter-container communication breach using network scanning tools like `nmap`.

3. **Monitor for Alerts:**
   - Observe detection system logs for any generated alerts based on predefined anomaly patterns.

4. **Analyze Results:**
   - Validate the accuracy of detected alerts against known adversarial behaviors.

## Response

When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate affected containers and restrict their network access.
   - Disable any suspicious container images from further deployment.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of logs to understand the scope and nature of the activity.
   - Determine whether it is an adversarial action or a false positive.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Patch identified vulnerabilities in the container runtime environment.
   - Update security policies to prevent recurrence of similar activities.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings and share with relevant stakeholders for further action and awareness.
