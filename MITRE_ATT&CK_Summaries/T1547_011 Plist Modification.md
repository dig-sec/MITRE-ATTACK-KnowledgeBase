# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by modifying plist files on macOS systems. Specifically, it targets T1547.011 - Plist Modification from the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1547.011 - Plist Modification
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** macOS  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/011)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring plist (property list) files for unauthorized or suspicious modifications. Key data sources include system logs, file integrity monitoring solutions, and process execution events. The patterns analyzed involve unexpected changes in plist files associated with persistence mechanisms such as launch daemons or agents, as well as privilege escalation efforts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often modify plist files to establish persistent backdoors or escalate privileges on macOS systems. These modifications might include adding new entries to launch daemons or altering existing configurations to execute malicious payloads upon system startup or login. Real-world execution involves commands like `plutil` for modifying plist files and the use of tools such as `launchctl` to load these changes.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - `plutil -replace Key -string "NewValue" /path/to/plist.plist`
  - `sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.example.plist`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection assumes that all critical plist files are known and monitored.
- It may not detect modifications in dynamically created or obfuscated plist files.
- Assumes plist modifications directly correlate with malicious activity, which might not always be the case.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate system updates or software installations altering plist configurations.
- User-initiated changes to system settings through graphical interfaces that modify plist files.
- Automated backup or synchronization processes involving plist files.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Plist modifications can lead to significant persistence and privilege escalation, allowing adversaries long-term access to systems. Early detection is crucial for mitigating potential damage and preventing further compromise.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
None available

## Response
When the alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify the integrity of modified plist files against known baselines.
2. **Correlate Events:** Check related logs for additional signs of compromise, such as suspicious process executions or network activity.
3. **Containment:** Temporarily disable affected launch daemons or agents to prevent further execution.
4. **Remediation:** Restore plist files from trusted backups and apply security patches if necessary.
5. **Reporting:** Document findings and update incident response plans accordingly.
