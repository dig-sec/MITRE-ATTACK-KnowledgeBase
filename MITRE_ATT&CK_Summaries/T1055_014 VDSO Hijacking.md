## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring anomalous interactions with VDSO, which is commonly used for efficient system calls in Linux environments. This involves the analysis of:

- **Data Sources:** 
  - Kernel logs
  - System call traces
  - Process execution paths
  - Memory usage anomalies

- **Patterns Analyzed:**
  - Unexpected modifications to shared libraries or memory regions associated with VDSO.
  - Unusual system calls that interact directly with the VDSO.
  - Processes executing with escalated privileges following interactions with VDSO.

## Technical Context

VDSO hijacking involves adversaries manipulating the shared memory space of VDSO, which is utilized by processes to execute certain system calls more efficiently. By altering this space, attackers can perform unauthorized actions without detection, such as evading monitoring tools or escalating their privileges within a compromised system. 

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

- **Sample Commands:**
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in VDSO handling to inject malicious code.
  - Using `ptrace` for memory inspection and modification.

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Observing kernel behavior under controlled VDSO modification attempts.
  - Monitoring privilege changes following suspicious system calls linked to VDSO access.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- Detection relies on the assumption that standard monitoring tools are in place, capable of inspecting low-level interactions with shared objects like VDSO.
- Limited visibility into kernel memory manipulation may result in undetected attacks.
- Assumes typical configurations without customized or hardened environments obscuring detection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities triggering false alerts could include:

- Legitimate system updates that modify shared object behaviors.
- Software that uses advanced optimizations involving VDSO for performance improvements.
- Debugging or penetration testing tools that interact with VDSO in a controlled manner.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:**
VDSO hijacking poses a significant risk as it enables adversaries to bypass detection mechanisms and escalate privileges, leading to full system compromise. The stealthy nature of this technique makes timely detection critical for maintaining security integrity.

## Response

Upon alert:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected system to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Log Analysis:** Conduct a thorough examination of logs around the time of the alert to identify unusual patterns or sequences in VDSO interactions.
3. **Memory Inspection:** Utilize memory analysis tools to verify integrity and detect modifications related to VDSO.
4. **Patch Management:** Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches addressing known vulnerabilities linked to VDSO manipulation.
