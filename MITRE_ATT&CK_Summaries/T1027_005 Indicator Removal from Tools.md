# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that leverage containerization technologies (such as Docker) to bypass security monitoring mechanisms. This includes detecting scenarios where adversaries use containers to hide malicious activities or remove indicators of compromise from their tools.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1027.005 - Indicator Removal from Tools
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/005)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy utilizes a combination of log analysis and behavior monitoring to identify suspicious container activities. Key data sources include:

- **Container Runtime Logs**: Capturing events related to the creation, start, stop, and deletion of containers.
- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Analyzing traffic patterns for anomalies associated with container communication.
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Observing changes within host filesystems that could indicate malicious manipulation.

Patterns analyzed involve unusual spikes in container activity, abnormal network connections from containers, and modifications to system files commonly associated with container operations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries use containers to execute code in isolated environments, making it difficult for traditional security tools to detect malicious behavior. They might modify or delete logs, tamper with monitoring agents, or manipulate container images to include malware while evading detection.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands**: 
  - `docker run --rm -it <malicious_image>`
  - `docker cp /etc/hosts:/tmp/etc_hosts malicious_container`
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Running a container with known vulnerabilities or malware.
  - Using scripts to automate the modification of logs post-execution.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots**: Detection may not cover all sophisticated techniques where adversaries dynamically generate containers based on environmental conditions. Some evasion methods might go undetected if they operate within expected baseline activities.
- **Assumptions**: The strategy assumes that container runtime logs are comprehensive and tamper-proof, which might not always be the case.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate deployment of microservices using containers in a DevOps environment.
- Scheduled tasks or cron jobs running within containers for maintenance purposes.
- Use of containers for testing environments where temporary and transient container instances are common.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are widely adopted across various industries, making them an attractive vector for adversaries to exploit. The ability to bypass security monitoring can lead to significant data breaches or prolonged undetected presence within a network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step emulation instructions are available. However, organizations should consider setting up controlled environments to test container-based evasion techniques and refine detection capabilities accordingly.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert**: Confirm that the detected activity correlates with known adversarial patterns.
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected containers and networks to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **Investigation**: Analyze container logs, network traffic, and file changes for additional indicators of compromise.
4. **Remediation**: Remove malicious containers, restore any altered files, and update security controls to mitigate the risk.
