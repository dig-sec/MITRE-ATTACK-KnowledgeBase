# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to exploit remote services for gaining unauthorized access and conducting lateral movement within a network.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1210 - Exploitation of Remote Services
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring remote services for unusual activities that may indicate exploitation attempts. Key data sources include logs from Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), SSH sessions, and other remote access software. The patterns analyzed focus on:
- Unusual login times or locations
- Multiple failed login attempts followed by success
- Use of uncommon ports or protocols

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit vulnerabilities in remote services to gain initial footholds within a network. Common methods include brute-force attacks, exploiting known vulnerabilities, or using compromised credentials.

### Adversary Emulation Details
To emulate this technique:
1. Simulate failed login attempts on an RDP server.
2. Follow with a successful login from a different geographic location or IP range.
3. Use tools like `Hydra` for brute-force simulation or `Metasploit` to exploit known vulnerabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all remote services are monitored and logged accurately.
- May not detect zero-day exploits if they bypass existing security measures.
- Relies on accurate geo-location data for identifying suspicious login locations.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate remote workers accessing systems from varying locations.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks using automation scripts that mimic failed attempts before success.

## Priority
**High**: Exploitation of remote services is a common entry point for attackers and can lead to significant breaches if not detected promptly.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the login by checking with the user or IT department.
2. Investigate any anomalies in login patterns or account activities.
3. Review recent changes or patches applied to remote services that might have introduced vulnerabilities.
4. Isolate affected systems if unauthorized access is confirmed.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available for this specific technique. Analysts should stay updated with the latest threat intelligence and security advisories related to remote service exploitation.
