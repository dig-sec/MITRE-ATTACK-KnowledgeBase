# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

The objective of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring mechanisms by exploiting container technologies. This involves recognizing and identifying patterns indicative of such evasion tactics across different platforms.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages container metadata and runtime behavior analytics to identify suspicious activities. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- System event logs
- Network traffic patterns associated with container operations

Patterns analyzed include unusual spikes in resource allocation, unexpected network communication between containers, and atypical user activity within containers that could indicate privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use containers to evade detection by leveraging their ephemeral nature and the isolation they provide. This can involve:

- Deploying malware inside a container to avoid traditional host-based defenses.
- Using containers to stage attacks, where malicious processes are launched within a container to probe network security measures before moving laterally.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
1. **Sample Commands:** Creating a container with elevated privileges using commands like `docker run --privileged`.
2. **Test Scenarios:** Deploying a known benign payload in an isolated environment and monitoring its behavior for signs typical of malicious activity, such as attempting to modify system files or communicate over unexpected ports.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Limitations:**
  - Ephemeral nature of containers may lead to incomplete logs.
  - High false positive rate due to legitimate usage patterns that mimic adversarial behavior.

- **Assumptions:**
  - All containerized environments are adequately instrumented for logging.
  - Network traffic analysis tools are integrated with the container orchestration platform.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger alerts include:

- Legitimate high-resource operations during peak loads or maintenance tasks.
- Authorized network scanning or penetration testing within corporate policies.

These activities can exhibit similar patterns to malicious attempts, such as spikes in resource usage or anomalous network traffic.

## Priority

**Severity:** High  
**Justification:** The technique poses a significant risk due to its ability to conceal adversarial actions effectively. Containers are widely used across industries for their scalability and efficiency, increasing the potential impact of successful evasion techniques.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Verify if the container activity aligns with expected behavior.
   - Check whether it correlates with any known operations or scheduled maintenance tasks.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the suspicious container from the network and other services.
   - Prevent further execution of its processes.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Collect and analyze logs for detailed activity within the container.
   - Review recent changes to container configurations and user activities that might have led to the alert.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Apply security patches or updates if vulnerabilities are identified.
   - Adjust monitoring rules to reduce false positives while maintaining detection capabilities.
