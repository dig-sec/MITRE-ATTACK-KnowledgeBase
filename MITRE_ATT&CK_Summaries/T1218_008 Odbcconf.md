# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report for Adversarial Use of `odbcconf.exe`

## **Goal**
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging `odbcconf.exe` on Windows platforms, specifically for executing arbitrary DLLs and loading response files.

## **Categorization**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1218.008 - Odbcconf
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/008)

## **Strategy Abstract**
The detection strategy leverages monitoring of Windows event logs, process creation events, and file access patterns. The primary data sources include Sysmon (System Monitor), Windows Event Logs (specifically Event ID 4688 for process creations), and behavioral analysis tools that can identify unusual usage patterns of `odbcconf.exe`. Patterns analyzed focus on the invocation of `odbcconf.exe` with arguments indicative of loading external DLLs or response files not typically associated with legitimate operations.

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries exploit `odbcconf.exe`, a legitimate Microsoft tool, to load arbitrary DLLs and configure ODBC data sources without triggering typical security controls. This method allows them to execute code under the guise of routine configuration activities. 

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Command for Arbitrary DLL Execution:**
  ```bash
  odbcconf.exe /u /A "path\to\malicious.dll"
  ```
- **Sample Command for Loading Response File:**
  ```bash
  odbcconf.exe @responsefile.rsp
  ```

### Test Scenarios:
1. Create a benign and malicious DLL file.
2. Attempt to execute `odbcconf.exe` with both the legitimate configuration task and adversarial tasks (loading the DLL).
3. Monitor for event logs indicating unusual argument patterns in process creation.

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- **Assumptions:** The detection assumes that any non-standard use of `odbcconf.exe`, such as loading external DLLs or response files, is adversarial.
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Legitimate administrative tasks using similar patterns may not be fully distinguished from malicious activities.
  - Encrypted payloads within response files are challenging to analyze without decrypting them.

## **False Positives**
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- IT administrators performing legitimate configuration changes with `odbcconf.exe`.
- Use of custom scripts or automation tools that leverage `odbcconf.exe` in unconventional but non-malicious ways.

## **Priority**
The priority for detecting this technique is assessed as **High** due to its capability to evade detection systems and execute arbitrary code on privileged processes, potentially leading to significant breaches if undetected.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Set Up a Test Environment:**
   - Ensure Sysmon is installed and configured to log process creation events.
   - Enable detailed logging for ODBC configurations in Windows Event Logs.

2. **Emulate Technique 1: Execute Arbitrary DLL**
   - Create a benign DLL named `test.dll` and place it in a known directory.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     odbcconf.exe /u /A "C:\path\to\test.dll"
     ```
   - Monitor for Event ID 4688 with unusual arguments indicating DLL loading.

3. **Emulate Technique 2: Load Response File**
   - Create a response file `responsefile.rsp` that configures ODBC settings.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     odbcconf.exe @C:\path\to\responsefile.rsp
     ```
   - Check for any anomalies in process creation events or configuration changes.

4. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Verify detection by reviewing Sysmon logs and Windows Event Viewer for suspicious activity related to `odbcconf.exe`.

## **Response**
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Initial Assessment:** Confirm the legitimacy of the observed activity by cross-referencing with known administrative tasks.
2. **Containment:** If malicious, isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.
3. **Investigation:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact.
4. **Remediation:** Remove any unauthorized DLLs or configurations introduced by adversaries.
