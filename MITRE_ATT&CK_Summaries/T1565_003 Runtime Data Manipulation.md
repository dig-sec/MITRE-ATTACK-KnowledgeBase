# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Runtime Data Manipulation via Containers

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by exploiting container environments for runtime data manipulation.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1565.003 - Runtime Data Manipulation
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Impact
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
  - [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/003)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on identifying runtime data manipulation within containerized environments. By leveraging various data sources such as container logs, host system monitoring tools, and network traffic analysis, the strategy aims to detect anomalies that suggest adversarial actions. Key patterns analyzed include:

- Unexpected changes in process behavior or memory states.
- Unusual inter-container communication patterns.
- Anomalous file or directory access within containers.

The strategy involves cross-referencing these patterns against known baselines to identify deviations indicative of manipulation attempts.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit runtime data manipulation by leveraging the ephemeral nature and isolated environment of containers. They may inject malicious code into running processes, modify process memory, or utilize container escape techniques to influence host-level operations. Common methods include:

- **Process Injection:** Inserting malicious processes within a target application's memory space.
- **File System Manipulation:** Altering files accessed by applications at runtime.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique, an adversary might execute commands such as:

```bash
# Example: Using the `process-inject` utility to inject code into a running container process.
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
cd /path/to/injection_tool/
./process-inject --target_process_name <app_name>
```

This command simulates the injection of malicious code into an application's memory space within a running container.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss sophisticated techniques that mimic benign operations or use zero-day vulnerabilities.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes baseline behavior is well-established, and deviations are accurately indicative of adversarial actions. Also assumes comprehensive monitoring coverage across all relevant data sources.

## False Positives

Potential false positives include:

- Legitimate software updates causing temporary process or file changes.
- Misconfigured containers leading to unusual inter-container communications.
- Debugging activities by system administrators that alter runtime states.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

**Justification:** Runtime data manipulation poses a significant threat as it can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and disruption of critical services. The ephemeral nature of containers makes such attacks particularly challenging to detect and mitigate promptly.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm that detected anomalies are not false positives by reviewing recent changes or maintenance activities.
2. **Isolate Affected Containers:** Temporarily halt suspicious container instances to prevent further manipulation.
3. **Investigate Anomalies:** Analyze logs and network traffic for indicators of compromise (IoCs).
4. **Remediate the Environment:** Remove malicious artifacts, update affected systems, and restore baseline configurations.
5. **Update Detection Rules:** Refine detection rules based on insights gained to reduce future false positives.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional resources are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework for further context on this technique. Continuous monitoring of emerging threat intelligence is recommended to stay informed about new methods and indicators related to runtime data manipulation via containers.
