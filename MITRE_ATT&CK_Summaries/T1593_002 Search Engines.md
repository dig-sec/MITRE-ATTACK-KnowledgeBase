# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Adversarial Use of Containers to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to use containers as a means to bypass existing security monitoring systems.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1593.002 - Search Engines
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Repository)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593/002)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on identifying adversarial use of container technology to evade security measures. It leverages data from logs related to container orchestration platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes, network traffic monitoring systems, and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). The analysis looks for unusual patterns such as:

- Spikes in container creation or modification activities.
- Anomalous communication between containers and external endpoints.
- Unusual volume of outbound data from containers to unknown domains.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit the flexibility and isolation features of containers to conduct malicious activities while evading detection. They often create ephemeral containers that execute their payloads briefly before terminating, leaving minimal traces on the host system. 

### Real-world Execution:
1. **Container Orchestration Manipulation:** Adversaries may manipulate orchestration tools to spin up numerous transient containers rapidly.
2. **Network Traffic Evasion:** Containers are configured to communicate with external servers using encrypted channels that bypass traditional network security controls.

### Sample Commands and Test Scenarios
- Command to create a temporary container: 
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -d <malicious_image>
  ```
- Kubernetes pod creation for ephemeral activities:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: malicious-pod
  spec:
    containers:
    - name: bad-container
      image: <malicious_image>
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection of stealthy communications that utilize non-standard ports or encrypted channels.
  - Containers leveraging legitimate services for malicious activities.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Regular monitoring setup exists to capture container-related logs.
  - Security tools are updated to recognize new and evolving threat patterns related to containers.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate CI/CD pipelines using containers for testing purposes, causing spikes in container creation.
- High-volume data processing applications running within containers leading to unusual outbound traffic.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The use of containers by adversaries represents a significant threat due to the ability to rapidly deploy and remove malicious code while avoiding detection. This can lead to critical breaches if not promptly identified and mitigated.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available for emulating this technique in a test environment.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected containers from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the container logs and activities.
  
- **Investigation:**
  - Identify any connections made by the suspicious containers to external IP addresses or domains.
  - Review recent changes in container orchestration policies that might have been exploited.

Currently, there are no additional references or context available beyond those provided above. It is recommended to stay updated with evolving techniques related to container-based attacks and adapt detection strategies accordingly.
