# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. The objective is to identify tactics employed by adversaries to evade detection mechanisms within containerized environments.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1205 - Traffic Signaling
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Persistence, Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Network

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container traffic for unusual patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. Key data sources include network logs, container runtime metrics, and host system events. Patterns analyzed involve anomalous communication with external IP addresses, unexpected container image pulls, or deviations in resource usage that suggest hidden payloads or command-and-control activities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by embedding malicious code within container images, exploiting container escape vulnerabilities, or using legitimate services as a facade for C2 communications. Common adversary actions include:
- Injecting malware into containerized applications.
- Using steganography to hide commands within network traffic.
- Exploiting orchestration tools like Kubernetes to spread across clusters.

Adversary emulation details might involve deploying known malicious container images and observing their behavior under typical network monitoring setups.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover zero-day vulnerabilities in container engines.
  - Encrypted traffic analysis limitations can obscure certain adversarial tactics.
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes baseline knowledge of normal network behavior for accurate anomaly detection.
  - Relies on comprehensive logging across all layers of the infrastructure.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate container orchestration activities that mimic adversarial patterns (e.g., CI/CD deployments).
- Network traffic spikes due to legitimate high-load applications or services.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used in enterprise environments, and adversaries frequently exploit them for persistence and evasion. The ability of containers to facilitate rapid deployment and scaling makes them attractive targets for malicious activities, necessitating robust detection mechanisms.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
None available

## Response
When an alert triggers:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected container(s) from the network.
2. **Investigate Logs:** Examine network logs and container runtime metrics for indicators of compromise.
3. **Image Analysis:** Review the image history to identify unauthorized changes or suspicious payloads.
4. **Collaborate with Security Teams:** Engage with incident response teams for a coordinated investigation.

## Additional Resources
None available
