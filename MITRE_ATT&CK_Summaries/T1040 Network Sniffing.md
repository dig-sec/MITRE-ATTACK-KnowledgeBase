# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## **Goal**
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by exploiting containerized environments.

## **Categorization**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1040 - Network Sniffing
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access, Discovery
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Network
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040)

## **Strategy Abstract**
The detection strategy focuses on identifying suspicious network sniffing activities within containerized environments. Data sources include logs from container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes), host-level packet captures, and system process monitoring. The patterns analyzed involve unexpected or unauthorized network interface bindings, use of known sniffing tools (e.g., tcpdump, tshark), and anomalous traffic patterns indicating data exfiltration.

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries often exploit container environments due to their complexity and isolation capabilities. They may attempt to install packet capturing tools within containers that have access to host network interfaces or use container escape techniques to gain broader access. Common commands used in these scenarios include:

- `tcpdump -i any`
- `tshark -i eth0`
- PowerShell scripts for sniffing on Windows containers

Adversary emulation involves deploying a benign instance of these tools within a controlled environment to observe behavior and network traffic patterns.

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
- Assumes that container orchestrators are configured with proper security policies.
- May not detect advanced evasion techniques where adversaries manipulate packet headers or use encrypted channels for sniffing.
- Relies on the assumption that network interfaces within containers should have limited access to host resources.

## **False Positives**
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate monitoring tools running for network performance analysis.
- Developers testing applications with built-in logging and debugging features.
- Network administrators performing routine maintenance or diagnostics.

## **Priority**
**High**: Container environments are increasingly targeted due to their growing adoption in enterprise infrastructures. The potential impact of successful bypassing of security measures can be significant, leading to data breaches and credential theft.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

### Packet Capture on Linux
- Use `tshark` or `tcpdump`:
  ```bash
  sudo tshark -i any -w capture.pcap
  ```
  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap
  ```

### Packet Capture on FreeBSD and macOS
- Similar commands as Linux using `/dev/bpfN` with `sudo`:
  ```bash
  sudo tshark -D
  sudo tshark -i any -w capture.pcap
  ```

### Packet Capture on Windows
- **Command Prompt**:
  ```cmd
  netsh trace start capture=yes tracefile=c:\capture.etl
  ```
- **PktMon**:
  ```powershell
  pktmon start -b
  pktmon filter add -p UDP --direction inbound -f "srcPort == 12345"
  ```

### Additional Scenarios
- **Linux with AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW**:
  ```bash
  sudo tcpdump -i any -w capture.pcap
  ```
- **PowerShell Network Sniffing**:
  ```powershell
  New-Object System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream($client.GetStream())
  ```

## **Response**
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. Isolate the affected container and host to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. Investigate logs for unusual patterns or commands executed prior to detection.
3. Review network traffic captures to identify potential data exfiltration.
4. Update security policies to restrict unnecessary network interface access within containers.
