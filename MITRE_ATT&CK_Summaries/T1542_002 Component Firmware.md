# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The aim of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using component firmware updates on Windows platforms.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages multiple data sources, including system logs, network traffic, and firmware update records. Patterns analyzed include unauthorized access to firmware management interfaces, unexpected changes in firmware versions, and anomalous communication with external entities during firmware updates.

### Data Sources Used:
- **System Logs:** Monitor for unusual login activities or changes in permissions related to firmware management.
- **Network Traffic:** Analyze for outbound connections that could indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.
- **Firmware Update Records:** Track unauthorized or unexpected firmware updates and modifications.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by gaining access to a systemâ€™s firmware update mechanism. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the update process or using stolen credentials to modify firmware settings, often leading to persistent threats that are hard to detect with traditional antivirus solutions.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Use of tools like `fwupd` on Windows to query and update device firmware.
  - Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the firmware management software.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Simulate unauthorized firmware updates by modifying the firmware version without administrative notification.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** The system logs are comprehensive and capture all relevant activities.
- **Blind Spot:** Adversaries using zero-day vulnerabilities that bypass logging mechanisms entirely.
- **Limitation:** Detection may not be effective if adversaries use encrypted channels for communication during firmware updates.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate firmware updates conducted by IT staff.
- Network traffic associated with routine maintenance tasks.
- System reboots or hardware changes causing temporary anomalies in logs.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
**Justification:** Firmware tampering can lead to persistent threats, allowing adversaries to maintain control over a system undetected. The stealthy nature of such attacks makes them particularly dangerous and challenging to remediate once established.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:
- None available

## Response
When an alert related to unauthorized firmware activity fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm that the detected activity is not part of a scheduled or authorized update.
2. **Containment:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze logs for additional signs of compromise.
   - Review recent changes in firmware and associated permissions.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Revert any unauthorized firmware changes.
   - Patch vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
5. **Follow-up:**
   - Conduct a thorough security audit to identify potential other breaches.
   - Update detection rules to minimize future false positives.
