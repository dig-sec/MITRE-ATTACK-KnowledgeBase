# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal

The technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves identifying malicious activities where adversaries exploit containerized environments to obscure their presence and evade detection.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1591 - Gather Victim Org Information
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Pre-Exploitation)

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1591)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring containerized environments to identify suspicious activities indicative of adversarial reconnaissance. Key data sources include:

- Container logs
- Network traffic within the container orchestration platform
- Metadata and configurations associated with containers

Patterns analyzed include unusual network connections, unexpected changes in container configurations, and anomalous access patterns that suggest information gathering.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit containerization to bypass security monitoring by using ephemeral containers to conduct reconnaissance. These containers can be quickly spun up and down, making detection challenging. In the real world, adversaries might use commands like `docker exec` or `kubectl port-forward` to interact with internal resources without leaving a trace.

### Adversary Emulation Details

- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --rm -it <image> /bin/sh`
  - `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/sh`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Spin up a container and establish network connections to internal services.
  - Modify container configurations without administrative permissions.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection might miss highly sophisticated adversaries using advanced evasion techniques.
  - Short-lived containers may not leave sufficient log data for analysis.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Containers are configured to generate logs that can be monitored.
  - Network traffic within the container environment is observable and analyzable.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative tasks involving frequent container creation and deletion.
- Normal network scanning by internal security tools for compliance checks.
- Routine updates or migrations of services within containers.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used in modern IT environments, making them a prime target for adversaries. The ability to bypass traditional monitoring mechanisms poses significant risks to organizational security.

## Response

When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Context:** Confirm whether the activity is part of legitimate operations or indicative of an adversarial attempt.
2. **Gather Evidence:** Collect logs and network traffic data from the affected containers for further analysis.
3. **Contain Threat:** Isolate suspicious containers to prevent potential lateral movement within the environment.
4. **Investigate Further:** Determine if other parts of the infrastructure are compromised or under similar threats.

## Additional Resources

Additional references and context are currently not available. Analysts should stay informed about emerging container security practices and threat intelligence related to adversarial tactics involving containers.
