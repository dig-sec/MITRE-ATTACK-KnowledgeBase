# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
Detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This technique aims to identify when adversaries exploit containerized environments to evade detection systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1555.002 - Securityd Memory  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/002)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access  
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS  

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous behaviors associated with containerized environments that may indicate attempts to bypass security monitoring. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- System process activity
- Network traffic patterns

Patterns analyzed encompass unusual access to sensitive memory regions, unexpected inter-process communications within containers, and deviations from normal container lifecycle events.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containerized environments by leveraging the isolation features of containers to execute malicious code without detection. Common methods include:

- Modifying container runtime configurations to avoid logging
- Injecting malware into legitimate container images
- Using kernel-level exploits to gain unauthorized access

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
Adversaries may use commands such as `docker exec` to run commands within containers or modify network settings using tools like iptables.

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Deploy a compromised container image and monitor for unusual processes.
2. Modify runtime configurations to disable logging and observe system responses.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss sophisticated attacks that completely evade existing monitoring systems or those that mimic legitimate traffic.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes the presence of comprehensive logging mechanisms and network visibility, which may not be present in all environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative tasks involving container management (e.g., updates, migrations)
- Misconfigurations leading to unexpected behaviors during normal operations

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
The ability of adversaries to bypass security monitoring poses a significant threat to the integrity and confidentiality of organizational assets. Containers are widely used in modern infrastructure, making this technique particularly dangerous.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Setup Test Environment:** Deploy a containerized environment using Docker or Kubernetes.
2. **Deploy Malicious Container Image:** Use an image with known vulnerabilities to emulate adversary behavior.
3. **Execute Adversarial Commands:** Run commands that mimic bypass attempts, such as disabling logging or altering network settings.
4. **Monitor for Alerts:** Observe the detection system's response and log any triggered alerts.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analyze logs to confirm whether the behavior is malicious or benign.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further spread of potential threats.
3. **Remediation:** Patch vulnerabilities, restore configurations, and enhance logging capabilities.
4. **Post-Incident Analysis:** Review incident response effectiveness and update detection strategies as needed.
