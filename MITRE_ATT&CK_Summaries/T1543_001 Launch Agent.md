# Detection Strategy Report: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers on macOS

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the use of containers on macOS systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources including system logs, process monitoring, and file integrity checks. Patterns are analyzed for anomalies in the creation or modification of Launch Agents, Event Monitor Daemon Persistence mechanisms, and unauthorized access to the root directory of launch agents.

### Data Sources:
- System Logs
- Process Activity Monitoring
- File Integrity Monitoring

### Analyzed Patterns:
- Unusual modifications or creations of `.plist` files associated with Launch Agents.
- Unexpected persistence behavior from daemons not commonly used on macOS systems.
- Unauthorized or unexpected access attempts to the `/Library/LaunchAgents/` directory.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often attempt to use macOS's native launch agents and daemons for persistence. They achieve this by creating or modifying `.plist` files, which define how and when applications are launched. Adversaries might also create a custom daemon that runs in the background and executes malicious code, leveraging Event Monitor DNSSD services for persistence.

### Real-World Execution:
Adversaries may use commands like `launchctl load` to activate their custom launch agents or daemons. They could employ tools such as `plutil` to modify existing `.plist` files or create new ones in key directories without authorization.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover all potential methods for launching a containerized environment.
  - Limited visibility into encrypted communications within containers if not properly decrypted by security tools.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that monitoring tools have sufficient permissions to access log files and system directories.
  - Relies on baseline data of normal user and application behavior to distinguish anomalies effectively.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate applications using launch agents for scheduled tasks or updates.
- System processes modifying `.plist` files during regular updates or maintenance tasks.
- Users with administrative privileges intentionally creating or modifying launch agents for legitimate purposes.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

### Justification:
The use of native macOS features by adversaries to establish persistence and elevate privileges represents a significant risk. The stealthy nature of these techniques can lead to prolonged unauthorized access, making early detection critical to preventing potential data breaches or system compromises.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

### 1. Launch Agent
- **Command:** 
  ```bash
  sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.plist
  ```
- **Description:** This command loads a custom plist file as a persistent background process.

### 2. Event Monitor Daemon Persistence
- **Setup:**
  - Create a `.plist` file in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`.
  - Use the `plutil` tool to convert it to binary if necessary.
  - Set up an event monitor using DNSSD services for persistence.
- **Command:** 
  ```bash
  sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.example.eventmonitor.plist
  ```
- **Description:** Establishes a daemon that runs in the background, potentially monitoring events or network activity.

### 3. Launch Agent - Root Directory
- **Setup:**
  - Create and place an unauthorized `.plist` file in `/Library/LaunchAgents/`.
- **Command:** 
  ```bash
  sudo cp com.example.plist /Library/LaunchAgents/
  ```
- **Description:** Tests the system's ability to detect unauthorized placement of launch agents.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Activity:**
   - Check the legitimacy of any newly created or modified `.plist` files.
   - Confirm whether related processes are executing expected tasks.

2. **Investigate Sources:**
   - Analyze logs to determine who created or modified suspicious files and when.
   - Identify any associated network activity that may indicate exfiltration attempts.

3. **Containment:**
   - Disable suspect launch agents using `sudo launchctl unload`.
   - Remove unauthorized `.plist` files from system directories.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Update security policies to prevent similar occurrences.
   - Consider enhancing monitoring capabilities for high-risk directories and processes.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings and update incident response plans as necessary.
