# Detection Strategy Report: Detecting Adversarial Use of Registry to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The primary objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to use Windows Registry for storing credentials as a means to bypass security monitoring. This technique often involves adversaries utilizing tools or scripts to leverage the registry as a storage medium, thereby avoiding traditional file-based credential storage that might be more easily monitored.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring the Windows Registry for unusual activities indicative of credential storage. Key data sources include registry event logs, process creation events related to registry access, and network traffic associated with tools known for manipulating registry keys.

### Data Sources:
- **Windows Event Logs:** Focused on events like `RegOpenKey`, `RegQueryValue`, and `RegSetValue`.
- **Process Monitoring:** Observing processes that commonly interact with the registry (e.g., `reg.exe`).
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identifying any anomalous communications that might indicate exfiltration of registry data.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Unusual increases in registry read/write operations.
- Registry modifications from unusual or non-standard locations.
- Use of known credential extraction tools interacting with the registry.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use various methods to store credentials in the Windows Registry, exploiting its persistent storage capabilities. Tools like Mimikatz or custom scripts can extract and store credentials directly within the registry, often bypassing traditional logging mechanisms. This technique is particularly insidious as it leverages a native system component that might not be monitored as rigorously.

### Real-World Execution:
Adversaries may execute commands such as `reg add HKCU\Software\MyApp\Secrets /v Password /t REG_SZ /d 'password123'` to store credentials. They can also use PowerShell scripts or batch files to automate the retrieval and storage of sensitive information within registry keys.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss stealthy techniques that obfuscate registry access or manipulate logs.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes baseline knowledge of normal registry usage patterns, which may vary significantly across different environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate software installations updating or querying the registry.
- Administrative tasks involving routine maintenance and configuration changes.
- Users manually storing non-sensitive data for convenience.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

The technique poses a high risk due to its ability to store sensitive credentials in an often-overlooked location, potentially facilitating further lateral movement within a network. The stealthy nature of this method increases the difficulty of detection and response.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a controlled test environment:

### Enumeration for Credentials in Registry
1. **Setup:**
   - Use a Windows VM with standard user privileges.
   
2. **Emulate Adversarial Activity:**
   - Execute the command: `reg add HKCU\Software\MyApp\Secrets /v Password /t REG_SZ /d 'password123'`
   - Use PowerShell to automate credential storage: 
     ```powershell
     New-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\MyApp\Secrets" -Name "Password" -Value "password123" -PropertyType String
     ```

3. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Verify the creation of registry keys using `reg query HKCU\Software\MyApp\Secrets`.
   - Check Windows Event Logs for corresponding registry access events.

### Enumeration for PuTTY Credentials in Registry
1. **Setup:**
   - Install PuTTY on a test machine.
   
2. **Emulate Activity:**
   - Configure and save PuTTY session credentials.
   - Use command `reg export "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions" sessions.reg` to observe changes in the registry.

3. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Look for related events in Windows Event Logs, especially under process creation logs for `putty.exe`.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential credential storage in the registry is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify if the registry modification correlates with known administrative tasks.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify how credentials were stored and whether they are being accessed by unauthorized entities.
4. **Remediation:** Clear any detected credential entries from the registry, reinforce monitoring mechanisms, and update security policies.

## Additional Resources
For deeper insights into adversary techniques involving the Windows Registry:
- Research on enumeration methods for credentials in the registry.
- Techniques used to extract third-party credentials via CLI tools.
- Case studies detailing real-world incidents of registry-based credential access.
