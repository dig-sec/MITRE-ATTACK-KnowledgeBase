# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify and prevent adversaries from attempting to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1558 - Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying malicious activities associated with the use of containers to evade security monitoring. Key data sources include container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), network traffic, system process activity, and authentication events. Patterns analyzed encompass unusual container image deployments, anomalous network communications from containers, and abnormal credential usage indicative of ticket forging attempts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to bypass traditional security controls due to their dynamic nature and the complexity involved in monitoring them comprehensively. Techniques include deploying malicious images that leverage stolen credentials or creating isolated environments for command execution without detection. In real-world scenarios, adversaries might:
- Deploy unauthorized container images that execute malicious payloads.
- Use forged Kerberos tickets to access network resources undetected.
  
Adversary emulation may involve creating a benign environment where containers are used to replicate these actions while monitoring responses from security systems.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Limited visibility into encrypted container traffic without proper decryption mechanisms in place.
  - Potential for zero-day exploits within container runtime environments that evade detection.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Containers are properly integrated with existing security monitoring tools.
  - Organizational policies dictate regular updates and patching of container orchestration platforms.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment of new container images as part of DevOps workflows.
- Authorized users accessing resources using Kerberos tickets for routine administrative tasks.
- Network traffic from containers used in approved data analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring poses a significant risk, allowing adversaries unrestricted access and the potential for extensive lateral movement within an organization's network. Given the increasing adoption of containerized environments, it is critical to address this threat vector promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no specific adversary emulation instructions available for this strategy. Organizations should develop their own test scenarios by:
- Simulating unauthorized container deployments.
- Executing controlled tests with forged credentials within a sandbox environment.
  
These simulations will help validate detection capabilities and refine alerting mechanisms.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Contain:** Immediately isolate the affected containers to prevent further unauthorized activities.
2. **Investigate:** Analyze logs from container orchestration platforms, network traffic, and authentication systems to trace the source of the anomaly.
3. **Eradicate:** Remove any malicious images or processes identified during the investigation.
4. **Recover:** Restore affected services to their normal state after ensuring all threats are mitigated.
5. **Document & Share:** Document findings and share insights with relevant teams to improve detection strategies.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional resources available for this specific alerting strategy. However, organizations can refer to industry best practices on container security and MITRE ATT&CK framework documentation for further context and guidance.
