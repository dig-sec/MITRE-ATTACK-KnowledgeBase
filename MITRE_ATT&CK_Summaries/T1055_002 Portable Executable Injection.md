# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Portable Executable Injection

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by injecting Portable Executables (PEs) into legitimate processes. This tactic allows attackers to execute malicious code with the permissions of a legitimate process, facilitating both Defense Evasion and Privilege Escalation on Windows platforms.

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages a combination of event logs, process monitoring, and behavioral analysis to identify patterns indicative of Portable Executable Injection. Key data sources include:

- **Windows Event Logs:** Specifically focusing on Process Creation events (`ProcessCreate`).
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** To detect changes in executable files.
- **Sysmon Logs:** For detailed process execution tracking.

Patterns analyzed include unusual parent-child process relationships, unexpected modifications to system binaries, and anomalous use of native APIs associated with injection techniques, such as `CreateRemoteThread`, `SetWindowsHookEx`, or reflective DLL loading methods.

## Technical Context

Adversaries execute Portable Executable Injection by leveraging legitimate processes to run malicious code. This technique often involves:

- **Reflective DLL Loading:** Where a single PE file contains both the DLL and the loader, executed in memory.
- **Thread Hijacking:** Using Windows APIs like `CreateRemoteThread` to inject code into another process.

Adversary emulation details include using tools such as `ReflectiveDLLInjection` or manual API calls to simulate these injection methods. Test scenarios involve injecting benign payloads into processes like `svchost.exe` or `explorer.exe` and observing the system's response.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may be evaded by adversaries using advanced anti-detection techniques.
  - Encrypted or obfuscated payloads might not trigger alerts.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has Sysmon configured to log detailed process information.
  - Baselines for normal behavior are well-established, allowing anomalies to be detected.

## False Positives

Potential false positives include:

- Legitimate software updates that modify executable files in a manner similar to injection techniques.
- Malware remediation tools injecting benign payloads into processes for cleanup purposes.
- Developer activities involving dynamic code loading or debugging tools.

## Priority
**High.** This technique is prioritized due to its effectiveness in bypassing traditional security controls and facilitating privilege escalation, which can lead to significant breaches if undetected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Portable Executable Injection

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure Sysmon and necessary logging services are active on a test Windows machine.
   
2. **Prepare Tools:**
   - Obtain or develop a sample Reflective DLL Loader and an associated payload executable.

3. **Emulate Injection:**
   - Execute the Reflective DLL Loader targeting a legitimate process (e.g., `notepad.exe`).
   - Monitor for corresponding Sysmon logs that indicate unusual parent-child process relationships or API calls.

4. **Analyze Logs:**
   - Verify detection through alerts generated from anomalous event patterns in ProcessCreate and Sysmon logs.
   
5. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove injected payloads and restore the system to its pre-test state.

## Response

When an alert for Portable Executable Injection fires, analysts should:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread of malicious activity.
2. **Log Analysis:** Review Sysmon logs and process histories to identify the scope and method of injection.
3. **Root Cause Investigation:** Determine how the attack was initiated and whether it indicates a broader compromise.
4. **Remediation:** Remove malicious payloads, patch vulnerabilities, and update security policies to prevent recurrence.
