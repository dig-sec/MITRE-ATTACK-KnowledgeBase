# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: AppCert DLLs on Windows

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to establish persistence and escalate privileges using AppCert DLLs on Windows systems.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1546.009 - AppCert DLLs
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/009)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages system event logs and file integrity monitoring to identify unauthorized changes in the AppCert DLLs. Specifically, it monitors the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\AuthRoot\Certificates` registry key for modifications indicating persistence mechanisms being set up by adversaries.

- **Data Sources:** Windows Event Logs (Security), Registry Monitoring
- **Patterns Analyzed:** 
  - Modifications to AppCert DLL registry keys.
  - Unexpected file creations or alterations in system directories related to Certificates.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit the AppCert functionality on Windows systems to execute arbitrary code via manipulated certificate trust relationships. By adding a malicious DLL with the `.cat` extension to this trusted path, they can execute their payloads when certificates are loaded by certain applications.

### Adversary Emulation Details
1. **Sample Command:**
   - An adversary might use `reg add` commands to insert entries in the `AuthRoot\Certificates` registry key.
   
2. **Test Scenario:**
   - Create a `.cat` file containing malicious code and place it into the trusted path directory, then register it with the system.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- Assumes no legitimate changes are made to AppCert DLLs as part of routine maintenance or updates.
- Might miss detection if adversaries employ anti-detection techniques like using authorized certificates for persistence.
- Relies on timely log collection and integrity checks, which may not be comprehensive across all environments.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate updates to the Windows certificate store by IT administrators or software applications.
- Changes due to system updates or patches from Microsoft that modify AppCert paths or registry settings.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: 
- This technique allows adversaries to gain elevated privileges and maintain persistence, potentially leading to significant security breaches.
- The ability to execute arbitrary code through trusted processes increases the impact on enterprise environments.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Set Up Test Environment:**
   - Use a controlled Windows virtual machine isolated from production networks.

2. **Emulate Technique:**

   ```shell
   # Create a malicious .cat file
   echo "This is a test payload." > C:\malicious.dll.cat

   # Add the malicious DLL to the system certificate store
   certutil -addstore "AuthRoot" "C:\malicious.dll.cat"
   ```

3. **Monitor Results:**
   - Verify if the registry entries for `AuthRoot\Certificates` have been modified.
   - Check event logs for any unauthorized access or execution attempts.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread of malicious activities.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation using forensic tools to determine the extent and method of persistence.

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Review event logs and registry changes for indicators of compromise.
   - Identify any unauthorized certificates or DLLs that have been added recently.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove malicious entries from the certificate store.
   - Patch vulnerabilities and update security policies to prevent future exploitation.
