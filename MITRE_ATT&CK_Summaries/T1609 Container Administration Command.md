# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

The primary aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through container manipulation. Specifically, it focuses on identifying unauthorized use of container administration commands that can facilitate malicious activities within a containerized environment.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages container runtime logs, configuration changes, and network traffic to identify suspicious activities. By analyzing patterns indicative of unauthorized command execution within containers, the system can flag potentially malicious attempts to gain control or bypass security measures.

**Data Sources:**
- Container Runtime Logs
- Configuration Management Systems
- Network Traffic Data

**Patterns Analyzed:**
- Unusual access patterns or permissions escalation in container environments.
- Command executions that are inconsistent with normal operations.
- Sudden changes in container configurations without proper authorization.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities within containers to execute unauthorized commands, often aiming to gain persistence or escalate privileges. This is typically achieved by exploiting misconfigurations or using administrative access tools like `exec` commands within Docker environments.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash`
  - `kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- /bin/sh`

These commands illustrate how an adversary might gain shell access to a running container, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or extract sensitive data.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss attacks that use sophisticated obfuscation techniques.
  - Relies heavily on the accuracy of log data; incomplete logs can lead to missed detections.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes all containers are monitored and logged consistently.
  - Assumes baseline behavior is well-defined for accurate anomaly detection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks such as maintenance or updates performed by authorized personnel.
- Automated scripts running routine checks or backups within containers, which may mimic adversarial patterns.

## Priority

**Severity Assessment: High**

Justification: Container environments are increasingly targeted due to their widespread adoption and critical role in modern infrastructure. Unauthorized command execution can lead to significant security breaches, making this detection a high priority.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Set Up Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a containerized environment using Docker or Kubernetes.
   - Ensure logging and monitoring tools are configured to capture relevant data.

2. **Execute Adversarial Commands:**
   - Use `docker exec` to gain shell access:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
     ```
   - Execute a harmless command inside the container to simulate an attack, e.g., creating a test file or modifying configuration.

3. **Monitor for Alerts:**
   - Observe if the detection system flags this activity.
   - Verify that logs and alerts align with expected adversarial behavior patterns.

## Response

When an alert fires indicating potential unauthorized command execution within a container:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Review logs to confirm the nature of the detected activity.
   - Identify the source and scope of the access.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected containers or nodes to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   - Revoke any suspicious credentials or permissions.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Patch vulnerabilities exploited by the adversary.
   - Update security policies and configurations to prevent recurrence.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings and actions taken for future reference and improvement of detection strategies.
