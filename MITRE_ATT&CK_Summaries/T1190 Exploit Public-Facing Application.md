# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that exploit container environments to bypass security monitoring systems.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract
This strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis, container orchestration logs, and behavioral analytics to detect anomalous activities indicative of an adversary exploiting containers. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Analyzed for unusual patterns in API calls and resource utilization.
- **Network Traffic:** Monitored for suspicious outbound connections or command-and-control (C2) communications.
- **System Activity:** Evaluated for unexpected changes in configurations or file integrity.

Patterns analyzed include abnormal spikes in CPU/memory usage, unauthorized access attempts to container management interfaces, and anomalous network traffic originating from containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit public-facing applications within containerized environments by:

1. Identifying vulnerabilities in the exposed APIs of orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
2. Using these vulnerabilities to gain control over container instances.
3. Leveraging compromised containers to conduct lateral movements or exfiltrate data while evading detection.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries might utilize:
- Exploitation frameworks such as Metasploit to target known vulnerabilities in Docker or Kubernetes.
- Custom payloads that establish C2 channels through encrypted traffic, making them harder to detect.

Adversary emulation can involve setting up a test container environment with known vulnerabilities and deploying tools like `kubernetes-client` to simulate attack vectors, observing how the system responds to unauthorized access attempts.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** Detection might miss sophisticated adversaries using zero-day exploits or heavily obfuscated payloads.
- **Assumption:** The detection system assumes that baseline normal activity is well-characterized and anomalies can be reliably detected against it.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate spikes in resource usage due to high-demand applications or services running within containers.
- Authorized but infrequent API calls made during maintenance windows or updates.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The exploitation of container environments can lead to significant breaches, as these systems often handle sensitive data and critical operations. Given the increasing use of containers in enterprise infrastructure, the potential impact is substantial.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific emulation steps are available for this technique. Organizations should develop tailored test scenarios based on their environment's unique characteristics and known vulnerabilities.

## Response
When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate affected containers or services to prevent further exploitation.
   - Review recent changes in the configuration or deployment of container orchestration platforms.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze logs for detailed information on the source and nature of the suspicious activity.
   - Examine network traffic to identify potential data exfiltration or C2 communications.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Apply patches to known vulnerabilities in container management software.
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities, focusing on identified blind spots.

4. **Post-Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the incident to refine detection strategies and update response protocols.
   - Share findings with relevant stakeholders to improve overall security posture.

## Additional Resources
As of now, additional references and context are not available for this specific strategy. Organizations should consult general resources on container security best practices and stay informed about emerging threats related to containerized environments.
