# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal

The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing container technologies. These adversaries may leverage containers to obscure their activities and evade traditional security mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis, host-based monitoring, and container orchestration logs to identify suspicious activities. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic:** Analyzing traffic patterns for unusual inter-container communications or outbound connections.
- **Host Logs:** Monitoring system and application logs for abnormal access patterns or resource usage spikes within containers.
- **Container Orchestration Logs:** Reviewing Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or other orchestration platforms' logs to detect anomalies in container deployment and runtime behavior.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual network traffic originating from known trusted containers.
- Unexpected changes in container configurations or permissions.
- Resource consumption that deviates significantly from normal baselines.

---

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit containers by creating isolated environments where they can execute malicious code without detection. This might involve using root privileges to modify container runtime settings or deploying containers with obfuscated payloads.

### Execution Example

1. **Container Escape:** An adversary gains control of a host process and escapes the container environment.
2. **Resource Abuse:** The attacker uses container resources to launch attacks, such as DDoS.
3. **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data is copied from the host or other containers.

### Adversary Emulation

- Deploy a benign application within a Docker container.
- Modify network settings to simulate unauthorized communication.
- Use tools like `kubectl` to alter resource limits and observe detection triggers.

---

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Encrypted traffic analysis is limited without decryption capabilities.
  - Zero-day exploits within container runtimes may not be detected immediately.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Normal baseline behavior is well-defined and continuously updated.
  - Security tools have access to all necessary logs and network data.

---

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate applications using containers for scaling purposes, leading to increased resource usage.
- Network traffic from authorized development teams testing new container configurations.
- Scheduled maintenance operations that temporarily alter container settings.

---

## Priority

**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The use of containers by adversaries represents a sophisticated threat vector capable of significantly undermining security monitoring efforts. Early detection is crucial to prevent potential breaches and data exfiltration.

---

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are currently not available. Future development should focus on creating controlled scenarios to validate detection mechanisms effectively.

---

## Response

When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm whether the detected activity is malicious or benign.
2. **Investigate Logs:** Examine network, host, and container logs for additional context.
3. **Contain the Threat:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further spread.
4. **Notify Relevant Teams:** Inform security and operations teams about potential threats.

Additional references and context are not currently available. Future updates should include links to relevant research papers, case studies, and tools that can aid in understanding and mitigating container-based threats.
