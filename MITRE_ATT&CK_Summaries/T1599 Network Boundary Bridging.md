# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection strategy is to identify and mitigate adversarial attempts that leverage containers to bypass traditional security monitoring mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy aims to identify malicious activities involving the use of containers that may attempt to circumvent security controls. The data sources utilized include network traffic logs, container orchestration platforms (such as Kubernetes audit logs), and host-level monitoring systems. Patterns analyzed encompass unusual inter-container communications, unauthorized access or modification of container images, and anomalies in container runtime behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit containers due to their lightweight nature and ease of deployment. They may use compromised or malicious containers to hide their activities within a network boundary that appears legitimate. Adversaries might deploy these containers to perform lateral movement across the network while evading traditional security tools designed for monolithic environments.

### Execution in Real World
- **Compromising Container Images:** Injecting malware into container images and deploying them across an organization's infrastructure.
- **Abusing Container Networks:** Using container networking features to bypass firewall rules or intrusion detection systems.
- **Manipulating Runtime Environments:** Altering the runtime environment to execute malicious code without being detected.

### Adversary Emulation Details
While specific sample commands are not provided, common emulation tactics include:
1. Cloning a legitimate container image and modifying it with a backdoor.
2. Deploying containers with unusual network configurations that bypass network security policies.
3. Using orchestration tools to create ephemeral containers that execute malicious tasks and self-terminate.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection strategies may not account for zero-day vulnerabilities within container technologies themselves.
  - Limited visibility into encrypted traffic between containers could allow adversaries to bypass detection unnoticed.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It is assumed that baseline behavior patterns are well-defined and accurately represent normal operational activities.
  - Trust in the integrity of the underlying infrastructure and container images is presumed, which may not always be valid.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development or testing purposes with atypical configurations.
- Temporary spikes in inter-container traffic during routine operations like automated deployments or updates.

## Priority
**High**: The increasing reliance on containerized environments across industries and the sophistication of adversaries targeting these platforms justify a high priority. Containers, if exploited effectively, can provide significant access to critical systems without detection.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no publicly available step-by-step instructions for adversary emulation specific to this technique within a test environment. Organizations should consider creating controlled scenarios to emulate the described adversarial behaviors safely and validate their detection mechanisms.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential container-based evasion activities fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should quickly isolate affected containers to prevent further lateral movement.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Examine logs from network traffic, container orchestration platforms, and host systems for signs of compromise or unusual activity.
3. **Incident Response Coordination:** Collaborate with security operations teams to determine the scope of the breach and mitigate potential impacts.
4. **Containment and Remediation:** Remove compromised containers, update security policies, and patch vulnerabilities identified during analysis.

Currently, there are no additional references available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework link provided in the categorization section. Organizations should stay informed through threat intelligence feeds and community discussions related to container security.
