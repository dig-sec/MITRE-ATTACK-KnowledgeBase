# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging container technologies. The focus is on identifying malicious activities where adversaries use containers to obfuscate their actions and evade detection.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1596.002 - WHOIS
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Pre-Execution)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596/002)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves analyzing network traffic, container activity logs, and host system behavior to identify patterns indicative of adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic Logs:** Monitoring for unusual or unexpected communication patterns between containers and external endpoints.
- **Container Activity Logs:** Tracking the creation, execution, and termination of containers for anomalous activities.
- **Host System Behavior:** Observing changes in system configurations or resource utilization that may suggest container misuse.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual network traffic originating from container IPs.
- Rapidly changing container lifecycles.
- High CPU/memory usage by containers without corresponding application activity.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit container technologies to execute malicious activities while avoiding detection. This is often achieved through techniques such as:

- **Container Sprawl:** Creating numerous short-lived containers to perform reconnaissance or exfiltration tasks, making it difficult for security systems to track.
- **Resource Abuse:** Utilizing legitimate containerized applications to mask command and control (C2) communications.

### Adversary Emulation

In a test environment, adversaries might execute commands such as:

```bash
# Launching multiple containers rapidly
docker run -d --rm <malicious_image>
```

Test scenarios include simulating high-frequency container launches or configuring containers to establish covert C2 channels.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss highly sophisticated adversaries who use advanced obfuscation techniques beyond current monitoring capabilities.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that anomalies in network traffic and container behavior are indicative of adversarial activities, which may not always be the case.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate development environments where frequent container deployments are common.
- Automated CI/CD pipelines that involve regular container updates or testing.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: The use of containers to bypass security monitoring poses a significant risk as it allows adversaries to conduct operations undetected, potentially leading to data breaches and other malicious outcomes.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no specific validation steps are available. However, setting up a controlled environment with typical container usage patterns can help in tuning detection systems to reduce false positives.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should quickly investigate the source and nature of the suspicious activity.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers or hosts to prevent further potential damage.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine whether the detected activity is malicious or a false positive by examining logs, network traffic, and container configurations.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional resources are available. Analysts should refer to industry best practices for container security and monitoring for further guidance.
