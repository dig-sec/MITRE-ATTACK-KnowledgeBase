# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Use of Containers to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to use containers as a means to bypass traditional security monitoring and controls.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1071.003 - Mail Protocols
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages log data from container orchestration platforms (such as Kubernetes) and host-based monitoring systems. Key patterns analyzed include anomalous creation or modification of containers, use of known bypass techniques such as privilege escalation within containers, and unexpected network traffic originating from containerized environments. By correlating these indicators across multiple sources, the strategy aims to identify potential misuse of containers for adversarial purposes.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit container technologies to conceal their activities or evade detection by leveraging the ephemeral nature of containers. In real-world scenarios, attackers might deploy malware within a container and use it as a pivot point to maintain command-and-control (C2) communications while avoiding traditional network monitoring tools that are not configured for containerized environments.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --rm -it <malicious_image>`
  - `kubectl run malicious-pod --image=<malicious_image>`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a benign container with elevated privileges.
  - Establish C2 communication via non-standard ports or encrypted channels within the container.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection may not cover all possible bypass techniques, especially those leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in container runtime environments.
- Assumes that security tools are correctly configured to monitor both host-based activities and container-specific events.
- May require significant tuning to minimize false positives due to legitimate use of containers for valid business purposes.

## False Positives
- Legitimate administrative tasks involving container management could trigger alerts, such as regular maintenance or updates.
- Normal operational traffic from applications running within containers may be misinterpreted as suspicious activity if not correctly contextualized.

## Priority
**High**: The increasing adoption of container technologies across enterprises makes this a critical detection priority. Adversaries frequently exploit popular and widely-used tools, necessitating robust monitoring to prevent significant security breaches.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific adversary emulation steps are available. Organizations should develop their own test scenarios based on the provided sample commands and technical context to validate the effectiveness of this detection strategy in their environments.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Quarantine affected containers or pods to prevent further potential misuse.
2. **Investigation**: Review logs from container orchestration platforms and host-based monitoring tools for signs of compromise.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the scope of the incident and identify any lateral movement within the network.
4. **Remediation**: Remove compromised containers, update configurations to prevent similar incidents, and patch vulnerabilities if necessary.
