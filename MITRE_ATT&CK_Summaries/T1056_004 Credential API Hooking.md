# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Credential API Hooking (T1056.004)

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify and prevent adversaries from using credential API hooking techniques, specifically `T1056.004 - Credential API Hooking`, to bypass security monitoring mechanisms on Windows platforms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** [T1056.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004) - Credential API Hooking
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection, Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This strategy leverages various data sources including process monitoring, memory inspection, and network traffic analysis to detect patterns indicative of credential API hooking. By focusing on anomalies in the behavior of credential-related APIs such as `LSA`, `SAM`, `winlogon`, and `NetUserGetInfo`, we aim to identify unauthorized modifications that could signify adversarial activity.

## Technical Context
Credential API Hooking involves intercepting calls to Windows credential management functions, allowing adversaries to capture or manipulate credentials. Adversaries typically achieve this by injecting malicious DLLs into legitimate processes (e.g., lsass.exe) to hook these APIs. A common method used is Mavinject, which injects a custom DLL into the target process.

### Execution Example
Adversaries might use command-line tools like PowerShell or Meterpreter scripts to perform credential dumping:

```powershell
Invoke-PSInject -ProcID <PID> -DllPath C:\path\to\mavinject.dll
```

This command injects a malicious DLL into the specified process, enabling API hooking for credential theft.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss obfuscated or polymorphic code that changes its signature to evade pattern-based detection.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes baseline behavior of systems is well-established to differentiate between legitimate and malicious activity accurately.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tools performing credential management tasks.
- Software updates or patches interacting with credential APIs in expected ways.

## Priority
**High**: Credential API hooking poses a significant threat as it can lead to complete compromise of user credentials, potentially giving adversaries control over sensitive systems and data. Early detection is crucial for mitigating such high-impact threats.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this technique in a controlled test environment:

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure a lab Windows machine with monitoring tools like Sysmon and a network sandbox.
   
2. **Execution:**
   - Obtain `mavinject.exe` from legitimate sources for testing purposes.
   - Identify the Process ID (PID) of a target process such as `explorer.exe`.

3. **Injection Command:**
   ```shell
   mavinject -p <PID> -d C:\path\to\malicious.dll
   ```

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Use Sysmon to detect DLL injection events.
   - Analyze memory snapshots for unauthorized hooking of credential APIs.

5. **Analysis:**
   - Confirm if the injected DLL hooks into `LSA`, `SAM`, or other sensitive functions.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential credential API hooking is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent further lateral movement.
2. **Detailed Investigation:** Examine logs and memory dumps for evidence of DLL injection and unauthorized API access.
3. **Mitigation:** Remove malicious code, patch vulnerabilities, and apply necessary security updates.
4. **Documentation:** Record findings and update detection signatures based on observed adversary tactics.
