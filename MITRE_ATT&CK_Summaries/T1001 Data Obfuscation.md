# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This detection technique aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting containerization technologies.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The strategy involves analyzing data from container orchestration systems, host-based monitoring, and network traffic to detect patterns indicative of obfuscation efforts. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Monitor for unusual container activities such as unexpected image downloads or modifications.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identify encrypted or anomalous traffic that may signify attempts to evade detection.
- **Host-Based Monitoring:** Watch for signs of rootkits or unauthorized privilege escalations within containers.

Patterns to analyze include:
- Unusual spikes in network activity from containerized applications.
- Atypical image pulls or deployments.
- Attempts to modify system libraries or files used by the host operating system.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers due to their lightweight and isolated nature, which can obscure malicious activities. They may use base images with pre-installed tools for privilege escalation, deploy hidden processes within containerized environments, or manipulate log outputs to evade detection.

### Real-World Execution
Adversaries often execute these techniques using the following methods:
- **Base Image Exploitation:** Using containers based on vulnerable base images to gain elevated privileges.
- **Log Tampering:** Modifying logs inside a container to hide command execution.
- **Network Evasion:** Routing malicious traffic through encrypted channels that mimic legitimate container communications.

### Adversary Emulation
Example commands and scenarios include:
1. Pulling a compromised container image:
   ```bash
   docker pull malicious/image:latest
   ```
2. Running the container with escalated privileges:
   ```bash
   docker run --privileged -d malicious/image:latest
   ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into internal container communications without deep packet inspection.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes baseline normal activity patterns for containers, which may vary across different environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of encrypted communication protocols within a secure network.
- Authorized deployment of new container images during regular maintenance or updates.
- Network testing operations conducted by IT teams.

## Priority
**Priority Level: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly popular in DevOps environments, and adversaries exploit their isolation capabilities to bypass traditional security controls. Given the potential for significant impact if exploited, this threat is prioritized highly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no detailed adversary emulation steps are available for validation purposes.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should review the container logs and network traffic for signs of unauthorized activity.
2. **Containment Measures:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine whether a security vulnerability in the base image was exploited and apply necessary patches.
4. **Update Detection Models:** Refine detection algorithms based on findings to reduce false positives and improve accuracy.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references are available beyond those listed above. Further research and collaboration with cybersecurity communities may provide more insights into evolving container-based threats.
