# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by utilizing container technologies. Adversaries may exploit containers' dynamic and ephemeral nature to obscure their activities from traditional detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring key data sources associated with container management and orchestration, such as Docker logs, Kubernetes audit logs, and container runtime environments. Patterns analyzed include abnormal creation or modification of containers, unusual network traffic originating from containers, and atypical resource usage patterns indicative of malicious activity.

Key Data Sources:
- Container Runtime Logs (e.g., Docker daemon logs)
- Orchestration Platform Audit Logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- Network Traffic Logs

Patterns to Analyze:
- Sudden spikes in container creation/deletion
- Unexpected network connections from containers
- Anomalous resource utilization patterns

## Technical Context
Adversaries may employ containers as a means to obfuscate their presence within an environment. By leveraging the lightweight and portable nature of containers, adversaries can dynamically create and dispose of environments to execute malicious activities while minimizing detection risk.

In practice, adversaries might use tools like Docker or Kubernetes for orchestrating these container-based attacks. Commands such as `docker run -d --rm` or `kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1` could be employed to launch ephemeral containers that perform specific tasks before self-terminating.

### Adversary Emulation Example
To emulate this technique:
1. Set up a Kubernetes cluster with basic monitoring.
2. Deploy a test application using `kubectl run my-app --image=alpine`.
3. Execute commands within the container, e.g., `kubectl exec my-app -- apk add curl`.
4. Observe the logs for unexpected container behavior or network traffic.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** Detection may miss sophisticated adversaries who use legitimate container usage patterns to mask malicious activities.
- **Assumption:** The organization has sufficient visibility into container orchestration platforms and runtime environments, which might not be true in highly decentralized setups.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate high-frequency testing or deployment environments where containers are frequently created and destroyed.
- Scheduled tasks within containers leading to periodic network access or resource spikes.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
The use of containers by adversaries represents a significant threat due to their ability to rapidly deploy, execute, and remove malicious payloads. The ephemeral nature of containers can lead to rapid obfuscation of activities if not promptly detected and mitigated.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific adversary emulation instructions are available for this technique. Organizations should consider developing custom scenarios based on their environment's unique characteristics and threat model.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential adversarial use of containers:
1. Immediately isolate affected containers to prevent further malicious activity.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation into the container logs, network traffic, and resource usage patterns for anomalies.
3. Review recent changes in orchestration configurations or deployments that might have introduced vulnerabilities.
4. Update detection rules and alert thresholds based on findings to reduce future false positives.
