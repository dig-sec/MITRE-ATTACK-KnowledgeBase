# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. Specifically, it focuses on detecting malicious initialization scripts that are executed during system boot or logon processes across various platforms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1037 - Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** macOS, Windows, Linux

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages multiple data sources to identify suspicious patterns indicative of T1037 techniques. Key data sources include:
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitors changes to critical system files and directories.
- **Log Analysis:** Evaluates boot and logon scripts for unusual activities or unauthorized modifications.
- **Container Activity Logs:** Tracks container initialization scripts for anomalies.

The strategy focuses on detecting unexpected script execution during boot or logon processes, unauthorized modifications of startup scripts, and the use of containers to obscure malicious activity.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often execute T1037 by embedding malicious scripts within legitimate system processes. This can be achieved through:
- Modifying existing boot or logon scripts.
- Creating new scripts that are executed during these phases.
- Using containerized environments to launch and hide malicious activities.

### Real-world Execution Examples:
1. **Windows:** Attackers might alter the Windows Registry to add new shell commands that execute during startup.
2. **macOS/Linux:** Manipulation of cron jobs or systemd services to run scripts upon logon or boot.

#### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Windows: `reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v MaliciousScript /t REG_SZ /d "powershell.exe -File C:\Scripts\Malicious.ps1"`
  - Linux: `echo "@reboot root /usr/bin/python3 /home/user/malicious_script.py" >> /etc/crontab`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Encrypted containers or scripts may evade detection if encryption keys are not accessible.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that all critical system directories and registries are monitored consistently across environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software installations or updates that modify startup scripts.
- Authorized administrative changes to boot or logon processes for maintenance purposes.
- Use of containerization tools for legitimate development tasks.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The technique poses a significant threat as it allows adversaries to establish persistence and escalate privileges by executing malicious code during critical system phases, often bypassing standard detection mechanisms.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no detailed adversary emulation instructions are available. However, the following general steps can be considered for validation:
1. Set up a controlled environment with monitoring tools enabled.
2. Implement benign and then malicious modifications to boot or logon scripts.
3. Observe alerts generated by the detection strategy.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected systems to prevent further spread.
- Analyze logs and scripts for indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Review recent changes to system configurations and scripts.
- Collaborate with incident response teams to remediate and recover.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available. Analysts are encouraged to refer to the MITRE ATT&CK framework for further context on T1037 and related techniques.
