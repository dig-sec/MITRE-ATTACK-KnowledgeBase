# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
Detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers across cloud environments.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Google Workspace  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/004)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages data sources from cloud service providers like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Office 365, and Google Workspace to monitor for anomalous container usage patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. Key indicators include:
- Unusual creation or modification of container registries.
- Atypical access to containers by non-administrative accounts.
- Unexpected cross-cloud interactions involving containers.

The strategy applies anomaly detection algorithms on logs from these platforms, correlating suspicious activities with known adversary tactics.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containerization technology within cloud environments to obscure their presence and actions. Common techniques include:
- **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining elevated access to create or manage containers.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Using containers as a medium for covert data exfiltration.
  
In practice, adversaries might execute the following commands:
- `docker pull <malicious_image>`
- Configuring container orchestration services (e.g., Kubernetes) without proper security controls.

**Adversary Emulation Scenario:**
1. Access cloud account with elevated permissions.
2. Create a new container registry and push a suspicious image.
3. Deploy the container across multiple virtual machines to test lateral movement capabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection might miss sophisticated adversaries using legitimate operational practices as covers.
  - Limited visibility into encrypted container communications without additional decryption mechanisms.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The detection system has sufficient permissions to access logs from all relevant cloud services.
  - Container activities are logged comprehensively by the service providers.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate DevOps operations deploying new containers as part of software updates.
- Standard testing environments where frequent container creation and deletion occur.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:**
The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers can lead to severe data breaches, unauthorized access, and significant operational disruptions. The widespread adoption of container technology in modern cloud infrastructures makes this a critical threat vector requiring prompt attention.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate affected systems or services.
   - Initiate forensic analysis on the suspicious containers to identify any malicious payloads.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review logs for related activities that might indicate a broader compromise.
   - Evaluate IAM policies and permissions associated with the involved accounts.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Update security controls around container deployment and management.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of access control lists (ACLs) to prevent unauthorized access.
