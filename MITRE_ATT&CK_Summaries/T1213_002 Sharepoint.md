# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers within Microsoft SharePoint environments.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1213.002 - Sharepoint
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection
- **Platforms:** Windows, Office 365  
[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous activities related to container usage within SharePoint environments that may indicate attempts to bypass security monitoring. Data sources include:

- **Log Analysis:** Examination of SharePoint and Windows Event Logs for unusual patterns.
- **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Detection of unexpected network traffic between SharePoint servers and external IP addresses associated with containers.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Identifying unauthorized changes in configuration files.

Patterns analyzed involve deviations from typical usage behaviors, such as:

- Unexpected modifications to SharePoint site configurations.
- Unusual file upload/download patterns indicative of data exfiltration.
- Abnormal network connections that do not align with standard operational requirements.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often leverage containers for persistence and lateral movement within networks. In the context of SharePoint environments on Windows or Office 365 platforms, they may:

1. Deploy a container to host malicious scripts.
2. Use compromised credentials to alter SharePoint configurations, allowing unauthorized access.
3. Exploit legitimate container tools to mask their activities.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique in a test environment:
- **Deploy a Docker Container** within the SharePoint server hosting scripts that simulate data exfiltration.
- **Alter SharePoint Configurations:** Change permissions using PowerShell commands to mimic unauthorized access.
  ```powershell
  Set-PnPSite -Identity "https://yoursharepointsite" -StorageQuota 1000GB -UserCodeMaximumLevel FullTrust
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection might miss sophisticated adversaries using encrypted channels.
  - Containers with legitimate use-cases may not be adequately differentiated from malicious ones.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes comprehensive log coverage and integrity.
  - Relies on the accuracy of baseline behavior profiling for anomaly detection.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate deployment of containers for development or testing purposes within SharePoint environments.
- Authorized configuration changes by IT personnel as part of routine maintenance or updates.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
The use of containers to bypass security monitoring presents a significant threat due to their ability to obscure malicious activities and facilitate lateral movement. Detecting such attempts early can prevent adversaries from gaining deeper access and exfiltrating sensitive data.

## Response

When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Anomaly:** Confirm whether the detected activity aligns with any known legitimate operations.
2. **Investigate Logs:** Examine SharePoint logs and Windows Event Logs for detailed context on the anomaly.
3. **Network Analysis:** Review network traffic associated with the suspicious container activities.
4. **Containment Actions:**
   - Isolate affected systems to prevent further lateral movement.
   - Revoke any unauthorized changes made to SharePoint configurations.

5. **Incident Reporting:** Document findings and report them according to organizational protocols for potential breaches or incidents.
