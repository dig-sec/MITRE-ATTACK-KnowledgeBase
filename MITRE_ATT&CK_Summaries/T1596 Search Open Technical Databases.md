# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves identifying adversaries who leverage container technology to obscure their activities and evade detection by traditional security controls.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring container activity logs and network traffic to identify patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. Data sources include:

- **Container Management Systems Logs**: These logs provide insight into the creation, modification, or deletion of containers.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: To detect unusual outbound connections that may indicate communication with malicious command-and-control servers.
- **System Call Monitoring**: For identifying abnormal system calls made by containerized processes.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual spikes in container creation and destruction rates.
- Connections to suspicious IP addresses or domains not typically associated with legitimate business operations.
- Anomalous resource usage within containers that deviates from normal operational patterns.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use containers as a means to obfuscate their activities, taking advantage of the ephemeral nature of containerized environments. By deploying malicious workloads inside containers, they can quickly spin up and tear down these environments, making detection challenging for traditional security systems.

In practice, adversaries might:

- Use popular tools like Docker or Kubernetes to create isolated environments.
- Exploit container orchestration vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- Leverage open-source intelligence (OSINT) to research potential weaknesses in the organization’s container infrastructure.

### Adversary Emulation Details

While specific commands and scenarios may vary, adversaries might:

1. Deploy a malicious Docker image from a compromised repository.
2. Use `docker run` with flags designed to minimize footprint or evade logging (`--rm`, `-d`).
3. Connect containers to external networks using tools like `netcat` for data exfiltration.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spot:** The detection strategy may not effectively identify sophisticated adversaries who use advanced techniques to mimic legitimate container usage patterns.
- **Assumption:** Assumes that all containers are appropriately logged by the organization’s monitoring systems. Lack of logging capabilities could result in missed detections.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:

- Legitimate spikes in container activity during deployment or testing phases.
- Authorized use of external IP addresses for accessing third-party services.
- Non-malicious resource-intensive operations within containers (e.g., machine learning model training).

## Priority
**High.**

The severity is rated as high due to the potential impact on organizational security. Containers can provide adversaries with a powerful means to bypass traditional detection mechanisms, enabling stealthy and persistent access to critical systems.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, there are no specific step-by-step instructions available for adversary emulation in this context. Developing a controlled environment to simulate adversarial container activities is recommended for further validation of the detection strategy.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm that the detected activity aligns with known malicious patterns rather than benign operations.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers and restrict their network access to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
3. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the container logs, system calls, and network traffic associated with the alert.
4. **Remediation:** Remove any identified malicious containers and update security configurations to close any exploited vulnerabilities.

## Additional Resources

No additional references are currently available for this ADS framework component. Further research into container-specific threat intelligence and monitoring solutions is advised to enhance detection capabilities.
