# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves detecting when adversaries leverage container technologies to obscure their activities from traditional security measures, potentially compromising system integrity and confidentiality.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on analyzing container orchestration and runtime logs to identify suspicious activities indicative of adversaries trying to bypass security monitoring. Key data sources include:
- **Container Runtime Logs:** Monitor for anomalous creation, deletion, or modification of containers.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Detect unusual communication patterns between containers that may suggest data exfiltration attempts.
- **Access Control and Configuration Changes:** Identify unauthorized changes in container configurations or access permissions.

Patterns analyzed involve irregularities such as unexpected spikes in container usage, unusual network connections, and unauthorized configuration modifications. These indicators help flag potential adversarial activities aiming to exploit container environments for malicious purposes.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to hide their tracks due to the lightweight and isolated nature of container technology. Common tactics include:
- **Creating rogue containers** with elevated privileges to execute malicious code.
- **Modifying host configurations** to disable logging or monitoring tools.
- **Leveraging side channels** for data exfiltration without direct network communication.

Real-world execution may involve using orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in these systems to deploy malicious containers. Adversaries might use commands such as `docker run -d --privileged ...` to create a container with elevated privileges or modify configurations via tools like `kubectl edit deployment <name>`.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** Detection may miss sophisticated adversaries who employ advanced obfuscation techniques within containers.
- **Assumption:** The underlying monitoring infrastructure is adequately configured to capture relevant data from container environments.
- **Gap:** Limited visibility into encrypted traffic or use of novel evasion tactics not covered by existing detection patterns.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate development and testing activities involving frequent creation and deletion of containers.
- Automated deployment pipelines that involve dynamic configuration changes to containers.
- Normal network traffic spikes during peak usage times in containerized environments.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The use of containers by adversaries represents a significant threat due to the potential for widespread impact on organizational security. Containers can be rapidly deployed and modified, providing attackers with numerous opportunities to evade detection. Given their prevalence in modern IT infrastructures, ensuring robust monitoring and detection strategies is critical.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no available step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment. However, organizations can consider developing scenarios that involve:
- Deploying containers with unusual configurations.
- Simulating network traffic anomalies between containerized applications.
- Testing the effectiveness of monitoring tools against these simulated adversarial behaviors.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential adversary activity within containers, analysts should:
1. **Verify Alert Validity:** Confirm whether the detected patterns align with known benign activities or if they indeed suggest malicious intent.
2. **Investigate Containers:** Examine container logs and configurations for unauthorized changes or suspicious processes.
3. **Contain Threat:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further potential damage, using network segmentation or container management tools.
4. **Mitigate Risk:** Apply necessary patches or configuration updates to address vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.
5. **Document Findings:** Record the incident details, response actions taken, and lessons learned for future reference.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional references or contextual resources available specifically related to this detection strategy. Organizations should consider consulting broader cybersecurity frameworks and threat intelligence reports to enhance their understanding of container-based adversarial tactics.
