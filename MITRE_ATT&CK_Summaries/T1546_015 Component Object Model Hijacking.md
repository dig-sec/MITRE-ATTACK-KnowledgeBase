# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using COM Hijacking

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using Component Object Model (COM) hijacking, specifically focusing on the technique described as MITRE ATT&CK T1546.015 - Component Object Model Hijacking.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1546.015 - Component Object Model Hijacking
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages log analysis from various data sources such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and PowerShell logging. The primary patterns analyzed include:

- Unauthorized modifications to the `InprocServer32` key in the Windows Registry.
- Execution of COM objects via PowerShell or other scripting languages.
- Anomalous usage of system utilities like `rundll32.exe` with unusual parameters.

By focusing on these data sources and patterns, we aim to detect attempts by adversaries to manipulate or hijack COM objects for malicious purposes.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use COM hijacking to gain elevated privileges or maintain persistence within a compromised environment. This technique involves modifying the `InprocServer32` registry key associated with certain DLLs so that when they are called, a different DLL is executed instead. Common methods include:

- Modifying the path of an existing COM server.
- Creating new COM objects that execute malicious payloads.

Adversaries might use PowerShell scripts to dynamically load and execute COM objects or leverage utilities like `rundll32.exe` with the `/tlb` flag to facilitate remote execution paths.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** The detection may not capture sophisticated attacks that use legitimate software in an unauthorized manner without altering registry keys.
- **Assumptions:** It is assumed that baseline logs are available, which accurately reflect normal system operations. Additionally, the environment should have minimal noise from benign COM operations to reduce false positives.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger alerts include:

- Legitimate software updates or installations modifying `InprocServer32` entries.
- Software designed to use dynamic loading of DLLs for functionality extensions.
- Misconfigured applications that inadvertently alter registry keys associated with COM objects.

Care should be taken to establish baselines and whitelist known legitimate operations during the analysis phase.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to escalate privileges or maintain persistence undetected poses a significant threat to enterprise security. Detecting such activities promptly is crucial in mitigating potential damage from adversarial actions.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **COM Hijacking - InprocServer32**
   - Open the Registry Editor (`regedit`).
   - Navigate to `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<CLSID>\InprocServer32`.
   - Modify the default value path to point to a benign or test DLL.

2. **Powershell Execute COM Object**
   - Use PowerShell to execute a benign COM object:
     ```powershell
     [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetActiveObject('WScript.Shell').Run("calc.exe")
     ```

3. **COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch)**
   - Execute `rundll32.exe` with an alternate path for testing purposes:
     ```
     rundll32.exe [alternate_path]\example.dll,entry_function
     ```

4. **COM hijacking via TreatAs**
   - Use the `TreatAs` command to redirect COM calls:
     ```
     TreatAs.EXE c:\windows\system32\calc.exe
     ```

These steps should be conducted in a controlled test environment with monitoring tools enabled to validate detection mechanisms.

## Response
When an alert for potential COM hijacking is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Source:** Confirm whether the activity originated from legitimate software or user actions.
2. **Analyze Context:** Review logs and events around the time of the alert to assess scope and intent.
3. **Contain Threats:** Isolate affected systems if malicious activity is confirmed.
4. **Remediation:** Remove unauthorized registry entries, patch vulnerabilities, and update security policies.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional specific resources available beyond those provided by MITRE ATT&CK for understanding T1546.015 - Component Object Model Hijacking. Analysts should refer to general best practices in endpoint and network monitoring when dealing with potential COM hijack attempts.
