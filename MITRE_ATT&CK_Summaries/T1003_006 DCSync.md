# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts that leverage containers to bypass security monitoring systems. By exploiting containerized environments, adversaries may attempt to obscure their activities from traditional detection mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1003.006 - DCSync
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activities and network traffic related to credential access attempts, specifically targeting DCSync operations. Data sources include:
- Container logs (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Network traffic analysis
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems

Patterns analyzed include unusual inter-container communication, unexpected network requests for domain controllers, and PowerShell executions indicative of credential dumping.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to execute DCSync operations by deploying tools like Mimikatz within a containerized environment. This allows them to perform lateral movements while attempting to evade detection by traditional endpoint security solutions.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- Use of PowerShell scripts to initiate DCSync requests.
- Deployment of Cobalt Strike payloads within containers to manipulate domain credentials.
- Sample command: `powershell.exe -NonInteractive -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Import-Module DSInternals; Get-ADReplAccount"`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss obfuscated or encrypted PowerShell commands.
  - Containers with minimal logging enabled might evade monitoring.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Security systems have visibility into container orchestration platforms.
  - Network traffic analysis tools are configured to monitor inter-container and container-to-host communications.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative actions using DCSync for maintenance or audit purposes.
- Scheduled tasks running PowerShell scripts for legitimate credential management.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring through containers poses a significant risk, as it can lead to undetected lateral movements and data exfiltration. Early detection of such activities is crucial to prevent potential breaches.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Deploy a container orchestration platform (e.g., Docker or Kubernetes).
   - Configure a Windows-based domain controller for testing.

2. **Emulate DCSync Attempt:**
   - Run DSInternals tool within a container:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm -it dsinternals/get-adreplaccount
     ```
   - Execute the following command inside the container:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe -NonInteractive -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Import-Module DSInternals; Get-ADReplAccount"
     ```

3. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Check container logs for unusual PowerShell executions.
   - Monitor network traffic for unexpected requests to the domain controller.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the activity by checking against scheduled maintenance or administrative tasks.
2. Isolate affected containers to prevent potential lateral movement.
3. Conduct a thorough investigation into the source and intent of the detected activity.
4. Update detection rules to minimize false positives while ensuring comprehensive coverage.
