# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify and thwart adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This includes the deployment of malicious containers designed to evade detection, manipulate data, or facilitate unauthorized access within a monitored environment.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1539 - Steal Web Session Cookie
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Office 365, SaaS, Google Workspace

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis, container runtime behavior monitoring, and anomaly detection to identify suspicious activities within containers. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- Network packet captures
- Container runtime events

Patterns analyzed include unusual inter-container communications, unexpected changes in container configurations, and anomalies in resource utilization that deviate from normal behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to isolate malicious activities, making it challenging for traditional security tools to detect threats. They might exploit vulnerabilities within the container ecosystem or misuse legitimate features to execute attacks such as credential theft (T1539), lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

Common adversary techniques include:
- Deploying containers with obfuscated payloads.
- Using ephemeral containers that self-destruct after executing a task.
- Manipulating network traffic to blend in with normal activities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection relies on the availability of comprehensive logging across all containerized environments.
- Assumes baseline knowledge of "normal" behavior within the environment, which may not account for legitimate but unusual workloads.
- May miss zero-day exploits or highly sophisticated evasion techniques that have yet to be documented.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate testing and deployment of new container images.
- Authorized use of debugging tools by developers.
- Network traffic patterns typical during peak business hours or maintenance windows.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant risk, as it can lead to undetected persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration within an organization. Given the increasing adoption of containerization technologies, addressing this threat is critical.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate the detection strategy, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Steal Firefox Cookies (Windows)**
   - Use a script to extract cookies from Firefox's `cookies.sqlite` database.
   
2. **Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows)**
   - Execute a command-line utility like `Chromium Cookie Editor` to access and export Chrome cookies.

3. **Steal Chrome Cookies via Remote Debugging (Mac)**
   - Set up remote debugging on macOS, then use JavaScript in the developer console to extract cookies from Chrome.

4. **Steal Chrome v127+ Cookies via Remote Debugging (Windows)**
   - Similar to Mac, but ensure compatibility with Windows-specific configurations for Chrome versions 127 and above.

5. **Copy Safari BinaryCookies files using AppleScript**
   - Use AppleScript on macOS to automate the copying of Safari's `BinaryCookies` file to a secure location.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify Alert Validity:**
   - Confirm if the detected activity aligns with known benign behaviors or legitimate operations.
   
2. **Contain and Isolate:**
   - Immediately isolate affected containers and networks to prevent further spread of potential threats.

3. **Investigate Anomalies:**
   - Examine logs, network traffic, and container configurations for indicators of compromise (IoCs).

4. **Remediate:**
   - Apply necessary patches or configuration changes to eliminate vulnerabilities.
   
5. **Report Findings:**
   - Document the incident, including response actions and lessons learned, to improve future detection strategies.
