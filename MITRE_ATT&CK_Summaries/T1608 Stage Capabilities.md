# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. Specifically, it focuses on identifying when adversaries use container technology to evade detection by traditional security tools.

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Execution)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources to identify suspicious container activity. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Monitoring for unusual or unauthorized container deployments and configurations.
- **Network Traffic:** Analyzing network traffic patterns associated with containers for anomalies that suggest evasion attempts.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detecting changes in container images or scripts that could indicate tampering.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual spikes in container creation/deletion rates.
- Containers accessing sensitive resources unexpectedly.
- Network communications from containers to known malicious IP addresses.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit container technology due to its rapid deployment capabilities and often less stringent security controls compared to traditional VM environments. By using containers, they can quickly stage attacks, deploy tools, or exfiltrate data without detection.

**Real-world Execution:**
- Adversaries may use popular orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to deploy malicious workloads.
- They might manipulate container images to include malware or stealthy backdoors.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - Deploying a container with modified configurations:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined <malicious-image>
    ```
  - Using `kubectl` to deploy stealthy workloads in Kubernetes:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: hidden-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: malicious-container
        image: <malicious-k8s-image>
    ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into encrypted container traffic can obscure detection efforts.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that baseline behavior for legitimate container activity is well-defined and monitored.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers for testing or development purposes, which may involve rapid deployment cycles.
- Authorized network communications from containers to external services for updates or data processing.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring poses a significant risk, as it can allow adversaries to operate undetected within an environment. Given the increasing adoption of container technology, this threat is both relevant and pressing.

## Response

When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm whether the container activity aligns with expected behavior.
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine if sensitive resources or data were accessed.
3. **Contain the Threat:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further spread.
4. **Investigate Further:** Analyze logs and network traffic for additional indicators of compromise.
5. **Report Findings:** Document the incident and share insights with relevant stakeholders.
