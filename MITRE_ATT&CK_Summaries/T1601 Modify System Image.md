# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. By exploiting containers, adversaries may attempt to evade detection mechanisms that are primarily designed for traditional environments.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container-related activities across the network to identify suspicious behaviors that indicate evasion tactics. Key data sources include container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker), network traffic logs, and system event logs.

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual or unexpected creation of containers.
- Containers running unauthorized processes or executables.
- Communication patterns between containers that deviate from the norm.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to encapsulate malicious payloads in an attempt to bypass traditional security controls. They may modify container images during build or runtime, or exploit misconfigurations within orchestration platforms to execute undetected code. This can include mounting sensitive volumes, gaining escalated privileges, or redirecting network traffic.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --rm -it --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN ubuntu`
  - `kubectl create deployment malicious-app --image=malicious/image`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Creating containers with elevated privileges.
  - Altering container images to include unauthorized software.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all legitimate container activities are well-documented and baseline behaviors are established.
- May not detect evasion attempts that do not generate network or system artifacts.
- Relies on accurate labeling and monitoring of container registries and orchestration platforms.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software updates within containers that alter their state.
- Routine maintenance tasks involving privilege escalation for administrative purposes.
- Developer testing environments where unusual container activity is expected.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
**Justification:** The ability of adversaries to bypass security controls using containers poses a significant risk, as it can lead to undetected lateral movement and data exfiltration within an environment.

## Response
When the alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Identify the container(s) involved.
   - Review logs for any unusual activities or communications.
2. **Containment Measures:**
   - Isolate affected containers from the network.
   - Review and update security policies to prevent similar occurrences.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Determine how the adversary bypassed existing controls.
   - Assess the extent of potential data compromise.

## Additional Resources
- Documentation on container security best practices.
- Research papers or case studies on known container-based evasion techniques.

This framework provides a comprehensive approach to detecting and responding to adversarial attempts to use containers for evading security monitoring.
