# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Service Exhaustion Flood (T1499.002)

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging a service exhaustion flood attack across multiple platforms and environments, including Windows, Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Linux, macOS, and Google Workspace.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous spikes in service requests that can lead to a service exhaustion flood. This involves monitoring network traffic, system logs, and API call volumes across the supported platforms.

### Data Sources
- **Network Traffic Logs:** For unusual patterns or large volumes of requests.
- **System and Application Logs:** To detect abnormal service behaviors or error rates.
- **API Usage Metrics:** Tracking API calls to identify unusual consumption patterns.
- **Identity Access Logs:** Monitoring for spikes in authentication attempts, especially in Azure AD and Google Workspace.

### Patterns Analyzed
- Sudden increases in request volumes across services that exceed typical usage thresholds.
- Consistent high error rates or timeouts indicating potential service overload.
- Unusual API call patterns that deviate from established baselines.

## Technical Context
Adversaries execute a Service Exhaustion Flood by generating a large number of requests to exhaust the resources of targeted systems, leading to denial of service for legitimate users. This can be executed using automated scripts or botnets targeting specific APIs or services.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** Scripted commands that generate thousands of simultaneous API calls.
- **Test Scenarios:** Simulate a flood by deploying scripts on test environments that mimic legitimate user requests at high frequency.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- The detection relies heavily on predefined thresholds for normal behavior, which may not adapt quickly to evolving usage patterns.
- Assumes comprehensive logging across all platforms, which might not always be the case in less monitored systems.
- Potential blind spots include encrypted traffic or services with limited logging capabilities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Scheduled maintenance or updates that temporarily increase service requests.
- Legitimate marketing campaigns or events leading to spikes in user activity.
- Misconfigurations causing repeated legitimate requests due to error handling issues.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
**Justification:** A successful Service Exhaustion Flood can lead to significant downtime, impacting business operations and potentially causing data loss. The widespread use of cloud services across platforms increases the risk and impact of such attacks.

## Response
When an alert indicating a potential service exhaustion flood is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Review logs and metrics to confirm the anomaly.
2. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Temporarily throttle or block suspicious IPs.
   - Increase resource allocation if feasible to handle unexpected load.
3. **Communication:** Inform relevant stakeholders about the issue and expected resolution time.
4. **Post-Incident Analysis:** Determine root cause and update detection thresholds or response protocols as necessary.
