# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containers. This involves detecting unauthorized access and manipulation within containerized environments that could indicate malicious activity.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1589.001 - Credentials
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Resources & Environments)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1589/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring containerized environments for unauthorized access or suspicious activity that suggests credential misuse. Data sources include logs from container orchestrators like Kubernetes, host-level audit logs, and network traffic analysis.

Key patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual changes to container configurations.
- Anomalous communication between containers and external IPs.
- Unauthorized access attempts using compromised credentials.

The strategy employs anomaly detection algorithms to identify deviations from normal behavior, supplemented by signature-based detections for known malicious activities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit container environments due to their isolated nature and rapid deployment capabilities. Techniques include:
- **Credential Dumping:** Using tools like `pspy` or `crackmapexec` to capture credentials within containers.
- **Evasion Tactics:** Modifying container images or configurations to avoid detection.

Real-world execution involves adversaries gaining initial access via phishing or exploiting vulnerabilities, then using stolen credentials to manipulate container resources for further reconnaissance or lateral movement.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Zero-day exploits in container runtimes may not be immediately detectable.
  - Encrypted traffic within containers can obscure malicious activities.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes a baseline of normal behavior for anomaly detection.
  - Relies on comprehensive logging and monitoring configurations.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate changes to container configurations during updates or maintenance.
- Authorized network traffic spikes due to legitimate business operations.
- Scheduled tasks executing within containers that mimic suspicious patterns.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used in critical applications, making them attractive targets for adversaries. The potential impact of compromised credentials includes unauthorized access to sensitive data and lateral movement across networks.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected container(s) to prevent further activity.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Review logs for unusual patterns or access attempts.
   - Analyze network traffic for suspicious external communications.
3. **Credential Revocation:** Invalidate compromised credentials and enforce a password reset policy.
4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine how the adversary gained access and patch vulnerabilities.
5. **Incident Reporting:** Document findings and share with relevant stakeholders.

- Comprehensive guides on securing containerized environments.
- Best practices for logging and monitoring in Kubernetes.
