# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Supply Chain Compromise via Octopus Scanner Malware

## **Goal**

This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts to compromise software supply chains using sophisticated malware like the Octopus Scanner. The primary objective is to identify and mitigate threats at the initial access phase, ensuring that malicious actors cannot exploit vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or applications.

## **Categorization**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1195 - Supply Chain Compromise
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Initial Access
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195)

## **Strategy Abstract**

The detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic analysis, file integrity monitoring, and anomaly detection in software supply chains. Key data sources include:

- Network logs for unusual outbound traffic
- File system access patterns to detect tampering with third-party libraries
- Software build and deployment pipelines to identify unexpected changes

Patterns analyzed involve anomalies in package updates, discrepancies between expected and actual code checksums, and unauthorized modifications in dependency management files.

## **Technical Context**

Adversaries executing supply chain compromises typically introduce malicious alterations into legitimate software packages. The Octopus Scanner Malware is a known example where adversaries inject malicious code during the software development or distribution process. 

### Real-World Execution

1. **Infiltration:** Attackers gain access to a developer’s account.
2. **Modification:** They alter source code or dependencies in a project.
3. **Distribution:** The compromised package is distributed through official channels.

### Adversary Emulation Details

- **Sample Command:** `git commit -am "Update library"`
- **Test Scenario:** Modify a dependency version in a project’s `package.json` file and push changes to a public repository.

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**

- **Assumption:** Continuous monitoring of package management systems.
- **Limitation:** Detection may not cover zero-day vulnerabilities or highly sophisticated obfuscations.
- **Gaps:** Lack of visibility into all stages of the software development lifecycle could hinder detection.

## **False Positives**

Potential benign activities that might trigger alerts include:

- Legitimate updates to libraries by authorized developers.
- Routine changes in package configurations as part of regular maintenance.
- False alarms from automated build tools making minor adjustments.

## **Priority**

**Severity:** High

Justification: Supply chain compromises can have widespread impact, potentially affecting numerous users and systems. The ability of adversaries to infiltrate trusted software repositories poses significant risks to organizational security and integrity.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Create a sandbox environment replicating a typical software development setup.
   - Use virtual machines for Linux, Windows, and macOS platforms.

2. **Simulate Infiltration:**
   - Gain access to the developer’s account using compromised credentials (simulate via local admin access).

3. **Modify Dependency:**
   - Access a project repository, e.g., using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git
     cd repo
     echo "suspicious-package" >> package.json
     git commit -am "Add suspicious package"
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Analyze network traffic for anomalies indicative of malicious outbound connections.

5. **Observe File Integrity Changes:**
   - Use tools like Tripwire to detect unauthorized changes in dependency files.

## **Response**

When an alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm if the change was authorized by checking with the development team.
2. **Isolate Affected Systems:** Prevent further distribution of compromised packages.
3. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Review access logs for unauthorized entries.
   - Assess the extent of changes and identify affected dependencies.

4. **Implement Remediation Measures:**
   - Revert to previous, verified versions of software packages.
   - Update security credentials and enhance monitoring protocols.

5. **Report Findings:** Document the incident and share insights with relevant stakeholders.
