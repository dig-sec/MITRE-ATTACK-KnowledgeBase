# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting container technologies. These adversaries may leverage containers to obscure malicious activities or evade detection mechanisms implemented on traditional host operating systems.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1557 - Adversary-in-the-Middle
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access, Collection
- **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, Linux
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous behavior and configuration patterns associated with container usage that may indicate adversarial intent. The approach includes monitoring:

- **Container Activity:** Unusual spikes in container creation, deletion, or modification activities.
- **Network Traffic:** Atypical network traffic patterns originating from containers, potentially indicating Command and Control (C2) communication or data exfiltration attempts.
- **Resource Utilization:** Abnormal resource consumption by containers that deviates significantly from baseline behavior.

Data sources utilized for this strategy include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- Network traffic analysis tools
- Host-based monitoring systems

Patterns analyzed involve deviations from normal operational baselines, unusual inter-container communication, and unauthorized access attempts to containerized applications or data.

## Technical Context

Adversaries might use containers to execute malicious code, store sensitive information, or establish covert channels for command execution. Containers can be lightweight and isolated environments that are often overlooked by traditional security tools, providing a stealthy medium for adversaries.

### Adversary Emulation Details
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. Deploy a container orchestration platform (e.g., Docker Swarm, Kubernetes).
2. Create a set of benign containers to establish a baseline.
3. Introduce adversarial actions:
   - Rapid creation and deletion of containers.
   - Configure network settings for unusual traffic patterns.
   - Use resource-intensive operations within containers.

Sample commands might include:

```bash
# Creating multiple containers rapidly
for i in {1..50}; do docker run --rm alpine sleep 10 & done

# Network configuration to simulate C2 communication
docker network create --subnet=172.20.0.0/16 c2net
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss highly sophisticated adversaries who use legitimate container processes to mask their activities.
- **Assumptions:** The baseline for normal behavior is well-established, and deviations are accurately attributed to adversarial actions rather than benign anomalies.

## False Positives

Potential false positives may arise from:

- Legitimate DevOps practices involving frequent container updates or deployments.
- Network spikes due to routine maintenance or software updates.
- Resource usage patterns associated with legitimate high-performance computing tasks.

## Priority
**High.** Containers are increasingly used in enterprise environments, and the potential for adversaries to exploit them as a stealth mechanism necessitates robust detection strategies. The ability to bypass traditional security controls can lead to significant data breaches or system compromises.

## Response

When an alert indicating adversarial activity within containers is triggered:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Temporarily isolate affected containers from the network to prevent potential spread.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Review container orchestration logs for unauthorized access attempts.
   - Analyze network traffic originating from suspect containers.
   - Examine resource usage patterns and correlate with known baseline behaviors.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Terminate suspicious containers after thorough analysis.
   - Update security policies to prevent similar future incidents.
4. **Reporting:** Document findings and update incident response playbooks accordingly.
