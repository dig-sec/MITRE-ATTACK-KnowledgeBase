# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Reflective Code Loading

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging reflective code loading mechanisms, specifically focusing on techniques such as T1620 - Reflective Code Loading. This method allows adversaries to load executable code into memory without writing it to disk, circumventing file-based detection systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** [T1620 - Reflective Code Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** macOS, Linux, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy aims to identify instances of reflective code loading by monitoring and analyzing the following data sources:

1. **Process Monitoring:**
   - Track process creation events, especially those associated with known reflective loaders such as `LoadLibrary`, `ReflectiveLoader`, or similar API calls.

2. **Memory Analysis:**
   - Analyze memory dumps for patterns indicating reflective code loading activities, such as unusual in-memory execution of DLLs or executables not present on disk.

3. **Network Traffic:**
   - Detect anomalous network traffic that might be indicative of remote code loading or downloading of malicious payloads into memory.

4. **Log Analysis:**
   - Examine system and application logs for unusual activities or errors that could indicate attempts to load code reflectively.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual process tree structures.
- Suspicious API calls related to dynamic linking/loading.
- Memory access patterns typical of reflective loading techniques.

## Technical Context
Reflective code loading allows adversaries to execute payloads directly in memory, bypassing file-based detection mechanisms. This technique is commonly used for evading antivirus software and endpoint detection systems that primarily rely on file scanning.

### Real-World Execution:
Adversaries typically use tools or scripts with reflective loaders such as `ReflectiveLoader`, which utilize Windows API functions like `LoadLibrary` to load executable code directly into memory.

#### Adversary Emulation Details
A common approach involves using a tool like WinPwn, which can reflectively load binaries like Mimikatz into memory:

```shell
# Example command to emulate reflective loading with WinPwn
WinPwn.exe -l Mimikatz.dll
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:**
  - Detection systems might not capture all variations of reflective loaders, especially custom or obfuscated implementations.
  - High false-positive rates can occur in environments with legitimate use cases for dynamic loading.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has sufficient monitoring capabilities to detect API calls and memory anomalies indicative of reflective code loading.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software development tools using similar techniques for testing or debugging purposes.
- Software applications that utilize dynamic linking/loading features as part of their normal operation.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

**Justification:** Reflective code loading is a sophisticated technique used by advanced adversaries to evade detection. It poses significant risks as it can bypass traditional security measures, potentially leading to successful execution of malicious payloads without being detected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this strategy in a controlled test environment:

1. **Setup:**
   - Prepare a virtual machine with Windows installed.
   - Install WinPwn or similar tools capable of reflective loading.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the following command to emulate reflective code loading:
     ```shell
     WinPwn.exe -l Mimikatz.dll
     ```

3. **Observation:**
   - Monitor process activity, memory dumps, and network traffic for indicators of reflective loading.
   - Verify that detection mechanisms capture the event.

## Response
When an alert indicating reflective code loading is triggered:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to determine the scope and impact of the incident.

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Review process trees, memory dumps, and logs for additional indicators of compromise.
   - Identify any other systems that may have been compromised using similar techniques.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Apply necessary patches or updates to prevent recurrence.
   - Enhance monitoring configurations to improve detection accuracy.
