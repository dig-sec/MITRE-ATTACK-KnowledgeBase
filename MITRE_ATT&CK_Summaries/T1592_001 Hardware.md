# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of Containers to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to use container technology as a means to bypass traditional security monitoring systems.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1592.001 - Hardware (Adapted for container context)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592/001)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy aims to identify suspicious activities related to the deployment and management of containers that could indicate an attempt to evade security monitoring. The following data sources are leveraged:

- **Container Orchestrator Logs:** Monitor Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or other orchestrators for anomalous scheduling patterns.
- **System Event Logs:** Track unusual hardware device installations or interactions indicative of container use as a stealth mechanism.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identify unexpected network communications from containers to external endpoints.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Rapid deployment and teardown of container instances
- Use of uncommon ports or protocols
- Containers operating without corresponding application-level activity

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit containers for several purposes, including evading detection by hiding malicious payloads within benign-looking applications. In practice, this involves deploying containers that mimic legitimate system processes while conducting unauthorized activities.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To understand and emulate these tactics, consider:

- **Sample Commands:** 
  - Creating a container using Docker: `docker run --rm -it ubuntu /bin/bash`
  - Setting up Kubernetes pods with non-standard resource requests to evade detection thresholds

### Test Scenarios

1. Deploy a container that mimics system processes.
2. Schedule frequent restarts of the container without legitimate application activity.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not cover custom or proprietary orchestrators not widely used in enterprise environments.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes standard logging and monitoring tools are in place to capture relevant data from containers and underlying systems.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers for development or testing purposes with rapid deployment cycles.
- IT operations deploying containerized microservices as part of normal business processes.

## Priority

**Priority:** High

**Justification:** The ability to hide malicious activity within containers presents a significant threat, especially in environments heavily reliant on containerization technologies. Early detection is crucial to prevent potential breaches or data exfiltration.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Deploy a minimal Kubernetes cluster using Minikube.
   
2. **Deploy Malicious Container:**
   - Use Docker to create a container with a hidden payload:
     ```bash
     docker build -t stealth-container .
     docker run --rm -d stealth-container
     ```

3. **Simulate Anomalous Activity:**
   - Schedule frequent restarts of the container without legitimate processes running.
   
4. **Monitor Logs and Traffic:**
   - Analyze orchestrator logs for unusual deployment patterns.
   - Check system event logs for unexpected hardware interactions.

## Response

When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. Isolate the affected environment to prevent further spread.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation of container configurations and associated network activity.
3. Review access controls and permissions related to container management.
4. Collaborate with development teams to ensure legitimate use cases are not disrupted.
