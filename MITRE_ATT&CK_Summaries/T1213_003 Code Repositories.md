# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Code Repositories (MITRE ATT&CK T1213.003)

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting code repositories, specifically focusing on the use of version control systems (VCS) as a means to store and transfer malicious artifacts or sensitive information.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages data from code repository platforms, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. It analyzes patterns like the sudden creation of repositories with suspicious names or content, frequent access to private repositories by unknown entities, and unusual commit activities (e.g., large binary files, sensitive data exfiltration). The strategy also examines user behaviors for anomalies compared to historical baselines.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use code repositories to store malicious code, exfiltrate data, or communicate with command-and-control servers. These platforms can be exploited due to their accessibility and the ability to host large amounts of data. Common adversarial tactics include:

- Creating new repositories with obfuscated names.
- Uploading sensitive files under misleading filenames.
- Using commit messages or branches as covert communication channels.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries might perform actions such as:
- Cloning a repository containing sensitive information without permission.
- Pushing malicious code disguised as legitimate updates.
- Executing scripts within CI/CD pipelines to automate attacks.

Sample Commands for Emulation:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/example/repo.git
echo "malicious_code" > payload.sh
git add payload.sh
git commit -m "update"
git push origin master
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into private repositories without appropriate permissions. Detection may not cover all forms of obfuscation or encryption used by adversaries.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that anomalies in repository activities are indicative of malicious intent, which might not always be the case.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate rapid development cycles with frequent commits and branch creations.
- Authorized users conducting large data migrations or updates.
- Use of automated scripts for legitimate CI/CD purposes.

## Priority
**High**: The ability to exploit code repositories poses significant risks, including intellectual property theft and the introduction of malicious code into production environments. Given the increasing reliance on SaaS platforms, this detection strategy is crucial for maintaining robust security postures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no specific step-by-step instructions available for adversary emulation in a test environment. However, organizations can simulate scenarios by monitoring repository activities and analyzing deviations from normal behavior patterns.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm if the activity is legitimate or malicious.
2. **Investigate User Accounts:** Review access logs to identify unauthorized access attempts.
3. **Examine Repository Content:** Analyze recent commits for suspicious files or messages.
4. **Assess Impact:** Determine potential data breaches or system compromises.
5. **Contain and Remediate:** Isolate affected repositories, revoke compromised credentials, and implement additional security controls.
