# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring by leveraging container technologies within cloud environments. This includes unauthorized use of containers that could obscure malicious activities or evade detection mechanisms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1069.003 - Cloud Groups
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Google Workspace

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring activities related to container deployment and management across cloud platforms such as Azure, AWS, and GCP. Key data sources include:
- **Log Files:** Monitoring logs from container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for unusual or unauthorized deployments.
- **Network Traffic:** Analyzing network traffic patterns that deviate from typical behavior associated with containers.
- **Access Logs:** Reviewing access logs to identify any anomalies in user permissions and actions related to container management.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Sudden spikes in resource allocation requests not aligned with historical usage.
- Creation of containers without proper authorization or by unrecognized users.
- Communication between containers that are not part of the standard architecture.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit cloud platforms' flexibility to deploy containers that can serve as both a tool for legitimate operations and a vector for bypassing security controls. They might use container orchestration services to dynamically create resources that evade traditional detection methods by:
- Deploying ephemeral containers that self-destruct after performing malicious tasks.
- Leveraging container escape techniques to move laterally within the cloud environment.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries may execute commands like `kubectl run` with elevated permissions or manipulate Docker images to include malware. They might also use services like Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) to programmatically deploy malicious containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not catch well-disguised legitimate container activities.
  - Containers that closely mimic normal behavior or are part of sanctioned cloud-native applications might evade detection.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The organization has baseline data on normal container usage patterns for effective anomaly detection.
  - Security teams have access to comprehensive logs from all relevant cloud platforms.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate spikes in resource allocation due to business-critical operations or maintenance tasks.
- Authorized deployment of new containers as part of software development and testing processes.
- Network traffic anomalies resulting from legitimate cross-service communication within microservices architectures.

## Priority
**High**: The ability of adversaries to use containers for evasion poses a significant risk, especially given the increasing reliance on cloud-native technologies. The potential impact includes unauthorized data access, exfiltration, and further lateral movement within the network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific adversary emulation instructions are available. Organizations should consider developing their own test scenarios based on this strategy framework to validate detection mechanisms in a controlled environment.

## Response
When an alert related to unauthorized container activity fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Initiate an investigation into the source and nature of the detected activity.
2. **Containment:** Temporarily restrict or terminate suspicious containers while maintaining system integrity.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine if there was any data breach or compromise.
4. **Review Permissions:** Re-evaluate user permissions related to container management and adjust as necessary.
5. **Documentation and Reporting:** Document the incident, including timelines, actions taken, and lessons learned.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references are available. Organizations should consult their security teams and cloud service providers for further guidance on implementing and refining this detection strategy.
