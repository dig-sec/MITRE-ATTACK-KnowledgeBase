# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to establish persistence via modifications to the system firmware on Windows platforms. Specifically, it focuses on identifying unauthorized changes to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), which can be used by attackers to maintain control over a compromised system even after reboots.

- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages a combination of endpoint data sources and firmware analysis to identify unauthorized modifications to the UEFI settings. Key data sources include:
- System logs for unusual changes in boot configurations
- Firmware management tools and APIs that monitor for unexpected alterations
- File integrity monitoring systems tracking changes to critical firmware files

The patterns analyzed focus on identifying non-standard execution of system commands related to UEFI, such as `bcfg`, which is used to modify boot configuration data.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often execute this technique by leveraging tools like `Wpbfbin.exe` to persistently embed malicious code within the UEFI. This allows them to bypass traditional security measures and maintain access to a compromised system across reboots.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In real-world scenarios, adversaries may use commands such as:
```bash
bcdedit /store <path_to_efi_bootmgr> /createobject /d "Malicious Boot" /application BOOTSECTOR
```
This command modifies the boot configuration data to load malicious code during system startup.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Limited visibility into firmware changes if the tooling does not support comprehensive logging.
  - Difficulty in detecting sophisticated, stealthy modifications that mimic legitimate UEFI updates.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes the presence of robust logging and monitoring tools capable of capturing detailed firmware activity.
  - Relies on pre-existing baselines for normal firmware configurations to detect anomalies effectively.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Authorized firmware updates conducted by IT administrators.
- Legitimate use of UEFI modification tools for troubleshooting or system recovery purposes.
- Changes in boot configuration due to legitimate software installations or updates requiring custom boot processes.

## Priority
**High**

Justification: System firmware modifications can allow adversaries persistent, stealthy access to compromised systems, enabling them to evade detection and maintain control. This poses a significant threat to enterprise security by potentially bypassing both host-based and network-based defenses.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Ensure the test environment is isolated from production systems.
   - Use virtual machines with Windows installed for testing purposes.

2. **Install Required Tools:**
   - Obtain `Wpbfbin.exe` or equivalent UEFI manipulation tools (ensure legality and compliance).

3. **Baseline Firmware Configuration:**
   - Record current firmware settings using a tool like `bcdedit`.

4. **Execute Malicious Command:**
   ```bash
   bcdedit /store <path_to_efi_bootmgr> /createobject /d "Malicious Boot" /application BOOTSECTOR
   ```

5. **Monitor for Changes:**
   - Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor file integrity and system logs for changes.
   - Verify that the test command has altered the boot configuration as intended.

6. **Detection Validation:**
   - Ensure alerts are triggered by unauthorized firmware modifications in a controlled manner.

7. **Cleanup:**
   - Revert any changes made during testing to restore original configurations.
   - Document findings and validate detection mechanisms' effectiveness.

## Response

When an alert for unauthorized UEFI modification fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the detected activity by cross-referencing with known maintenance schedules or authorized change logs.

2. **Isolate the Affected System:**
   - Temporarily disconnect the system from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.

3. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis:**
   - Analyze logs and forensic data to understand the scope and method of the modification.
   - Identify any additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) associated with the attack.

4. **Mitigate and Remediate:**
   - Restore firmware settings to their known good state using backups or recovery tools.
   - Apply patches or updates to mitigate vulnerabilities exploited during the attack.

5. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Update security policies and controls to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as enhancing logging capabilities for UEFI activities.
