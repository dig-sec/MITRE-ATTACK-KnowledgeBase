# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging containers on various platforms such as Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1025 - Data from Removable Media
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1025)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying adversarial activities that use containers to access or exfiltrate data from removable media. This involves monitoring container activity for unusual patterns such as unexpected mounting of external storage devices, file transfers involving removable media, and atypical processes initiated within containers.

**Data Sources:**
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- System event logs
- Network traffic analysis
- File integrity monitoring

**Patterns Analyzed:**
- Unexpected container creation or modification
- Mounting of external storage devices in containerized environments
- Data transfers to/from removable media

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containers due to their lightweight nature and ease of deployment. They can create isolated environments within which they attempt to access sensitive data on removable media without triggering traditional security alerts.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - `docker run --privileged -v /mnt/usb:/data my_container`
  - `kubectl exec my-pod -- mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt`
- **Test Scenarios:** Create a container with access to removable media and attempt file operations such as copying or reading files from the mounted drive.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all containers are monitored, which may not be the case in highly dynamic environments.
- May miss detection if adversaries use encrypted communication channels for data exfiltration.
- Relies on accurate logging of container activities, which might be tampered with by sophisticated attackers.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment or testing scenarios involving containers and removable media.
- Authorized administrative tasks where containers are used to manage external storage devices.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the technique can significantly aid in bypassing security measures, its detection is contingent upon comprehensive monitoring of container activities. The risk is moderate as not all environments may utilize containers extensively.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions to Emulate this Technique:

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install Docker or Kubernetes on a test machine.
   - Insert a USB drive and ensure it is recognized by the system.

2. **Identify Documents on USB via PowerShell:**
   ```powershell
   $driveLetter = (Get-Volume | Where-Object { $_.FileSystemLabel -eq 'YourUSBDriveLabel' }).DriveLetter + ":"
   Get-ChildItem -Path "$driveLetter" -Recurse | Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime
   ```

3. **Run a Container with Access to USB Drive:**
   ```bash
   docker run --privileged -v /mnt/usb:/data alpine sh -c "ls /data"
   ```

4. **Monitor for Unusual Activity:**
   - Check container logs and system event logs for any suspicious activity related to file access or data transfer.

5. **Analyze Network Traffic (Optional):**
   - Use tools like Wireshark to monitor any outbound traffic from the container that might indicate data exfiltration.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the container and its intended operations.
2. Check for any unauthorized access or file modifications on removable media.
3. Isolate affected containers to prevent further potential data breaches.
4. Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if the activity was adversarial in nature.
