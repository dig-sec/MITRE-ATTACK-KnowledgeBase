# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the use of containers. This includes detecting when adversaries utilize container technology to mask malicious activities and evade traditional detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous activities related to container usage that suggest adversarial intent. The primary data sources include:
- System logs (e.g., Windows Event Logs)
- Container orchestration platform logs (such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Network traffic monitoring

Patterns analyzed involve unusual configuration changes or executions within containers and abnormal network communications originating from these containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to execute malicious payloads while evading detection by traditional security tools. This technique involves adversaries configuring containers with settings that resemble legitimate processes, such as setting arbitrary binaries as screensavers (T1546.002). In practice, this might involve using container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to deploy and manage these containers.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `kubectl run malicious-container --image=malicious-image`
  - `docker run -d --name screensaver malicious-binary`

### Test Scenarios:
1. Deploy a container with an unusual or suspicious configuration.
2. Monitor for any unexpected network communications from the container.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss highly obfuscated container setups.
  - Limited visibility into encrypted traffic unless additional tools are deployed.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that monitoring systems have access to container orchestration logs.
  - Presumes a baseline of normal behavior for containers within the environment.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers by developers for testing purposes.
- Scheduled tasks or automated scripts running within containers that appear anomalous but are part of routine operations.

## Priority
**High:** The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant risk, as it allows adversaries to operate with reduced visibility and persistence within the environment. This technique can facilitate further malicious activities without detection.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Install container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker.
   - Configure logging for both system and container events.

2. **Deploy Test Container:**
   - Use `kubectl run malicious-container --image=malicious-image` to deploy a test container with a known benign but unusual binary set as the screensaver.

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   - Check Windows Event Logs, Kubernetes logs, and network traffic for any signs of anomalous activity related to the deployed container.

4. **Analyze Results:**
   - Confirm if the detection strategy successfully identifies the test scenario without generating excessive false positives.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Verify the Activity:** Cross-check with known legitimate operations or scheduled tasks.
2. **Isolate the Container:** Temporarily suspend the container to prevent potential malicious activity.
3. **Investigate Logs:** Analyze logs for any signs of suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts.
4. **Report Findings:** Document and report findings to security teams for further action.
