# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using containerization techniques for malicious activities.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1608.001 - Upload Malware
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Pre-Exploitation)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activities within an organization's network to identify potential malicious behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Network traffic associated with container communication
- File integrity and access patterns related to containers

The analysis involves identifying unusual or unauthorized operations such as:
- Spikes in resource usage indicative of malware execution
- Unexpected network connections from within containers
- File modifications that align with known malware signatures

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers for deploying malicious code due to their lightweight nature and ease of orchestration. This technique allows attackers to:

- Isolate malware activities within a container, reducing detection risk.
- Leverage container orchestration tools to scale malicious operations quickly.

### Adversary Emulation Details

In real-world scenarios, adversaries might execute commands such as:
```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/malware:/malware adversary_image /malware/malicious_binary
```

Test scenarios include deploying benign containers with scripts that mimic malware behavior to assess detection capabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** Legitimate use of containers does not typically involve malicious activities, which may limit detection sensitivity.
- **Blind Spot:** Encrypted container communication can obscure content analysis, potentially bypassing certain detection mechanisms.
- **Limitation:** Detection is less effective if adversaries employ sophisticated obfuscation techniques within the container environment.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of resource-intensive applications in containers (e.g., data processing tasks).
- Routine updates or deployments that involve file modifications.
- Network traffic from authorized orchestration tools and management interfaces.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant threat, as it can lead to undetected persistence and lateral movement within an organization's network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions
Currently, no specific adversary emulation steps are available. However, setting up a controlled test environment with benign containers mimicking malware behavior is recommended for validation purposes.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine suspicious containers to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Thorough Investigation:** Analyze container logs and network traffic for indicators of compromise.
3. **Assessment of Impact:** Determine if other parts of the network are affected or compromised.
4. **Remediation Measures:** Apply patches, update configurations, and enhance monitoring based on findings.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context are available. Analysts should stay informed about emerging container-related threats and best practices in detection technologies.
