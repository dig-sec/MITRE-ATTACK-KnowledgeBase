# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms using containerization technologies. This involves identifying when adversaries are leveraging containers to evade detection and monitoring systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring for unusual container activities and configurations that suggest an adversarial attempt to bypass security mechanisms. This involves analyzing data from system logs, process monitors, and network activity across all supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). Key patterns analyzed include unexpected changes in container runtime environments, suspicious processes within containers, and anomalous network traffic originating from or directed at containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to isolate their activities from traditional detection systems. They may deploy malicious payloads within containers that are configured to avoid triggering alerts on host-level security tools. Techniques include leveraging lightweight virtualization to run unauthorized applications, masking process tree structures, and modifying system configurations to prevent logging or monitoring.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Linux:** Use of `docker` or `podman` commands to spin up containers with evasive capabilities.
  - Example Command: `docker run --rm -it --privileged <malicious_image>`
- **Windows:** Utilizing Hyper-V or WSL2 for running isolated environments.
  - Example Command: `wsl --import <container_name> <path_to_disk_image> <path_to_log_directory>`
- **macOS:** Use of Docker Desktop or native macOS virtualization features.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that adversaries are knowledgeable about container technologies and their detection avoidance tactics.
- May not detect custom-built container environments specifically designed to evade existing monitoring solutions.
- Relies on the presence of comprehensive logging and monitoring at both host and container levels.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development, testing, or application isolation.
- Routine updates or deployments involving container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
- Misconfigured security policies that incorrectly flag normal operations as suspicious.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Given the increasing adoption of containerization in enterprise environments and its potential for misuse by adversaries to bypass traditional defenses, it is crucial to prioritize detection strategies targeting this vector. The ability to evade monitoring through containers poses significant risks to organizational security postures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Detect Virtualization Environment
- **Linux:**
  - Use `grep` on `/sys/class/dmi/id/product_name` or `/proc/cpuinfo` for vendor strings.
  - Command Example: `grep -i virtual /proc/cpuinfo`
  
- **FreeBSD:**
  - Check system hardware information using `dmesg | grep 'VMware'`.
  
- **Windows:**
  - Query WMI for manufacturer/model details:
    ```powershell
    Get-WmiObject Win32_ComputerSystem | Select-Object Manufacturer, Model
    ```

### Detect Virtualization via System Tools
- **Linux (`ioreg` equivalent):** 
  - Use `dmidecode` to check system information.
  - Command Example: `sudo dmidecode --type system`
  
- **Windows (ioreg equivalent):**
  - Utilize PowerShell to query WMI:
    ```powershell
    Get-WmiObject -Query "SELECT * FROM Win32_ComputerSystemProduct" | Select-Object Name, Vendor
    ```
  
- **Linux (`sysctl`):**
  - Check hardware model: `sudo sysctl hw.model`
  
### Detect System Integrity Protection and Other Features
- **macOS:** Use `csrutil status` to check if SIP is enabled.
- **General Detection:** Utilize `system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType` on macOS for additional system details.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
1. Immediately isolate the affected containers or hosts to prevent potential data exfiltration.
2. Review recent container activities and configurations to identify any unauthorized changes.
3. Analyze network traffic logs to determine if there was any suspicious communication.
4. Investigate system logs for signs of tampering with security settings or logging mechanisms.
5. Update detection rules and policies based on findings to prevent future occurrences.
