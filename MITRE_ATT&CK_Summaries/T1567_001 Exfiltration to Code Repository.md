# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems through the use of containers for exfiltration purposes.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1567.001 - Exfiltration to Code Repository
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Exfiltration
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container-related data sources to detect exfiltration attempts. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Network traffic associated with container communications
- File system activities within containers

Patterns analyzed include unusual outbound network connections from containers, unexpected or unauthorized access to code repositories, and abnormal file transfer behaviors within containerized environments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to exfiltrate data by embedding sensitive information within container images or through orchestrated service communication. This technique allows them to leverage legitimate tools and bypass traditional security controls that are less effective in containerized ecosystems.

### Adversary Emulation Details
In a controlled test environment, adversaries might:
- Use `kubectl` commands to push malicious containers to repositories.
- Employ scripts for automated repository pushes (e.g., using Git or Docker Hub APIs).
- Exfiltrate data by embedding it within container image layers or using side-channel communications.

### Example Commands
- Pushing a container with embedded data:  
  ```bash
  docker build -t adversary/repo_name .
  docker push adversary/repo_name
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Encrypted network traffic that cannot be easily inspected.
  - Containers running in environments with limited visibility (e.g., air-gapped networks).

- **Assumptions:**
  - Adequate monitoring coverage of container orchestration platforms.
  - Network access to inspect inter-container communications.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate CI/CD pipelines pushing container images or code changes.
- Routine maintenance operations involving network traffic between containers.
- Authorized data transfers within a secure, isolated network for business purposes.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containerized environments are increasingly common, and adversaries exploit them to evade detection. The ability to hide exfiltration activities makes this technique particularly dangerous, necessitating robust detection measures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no detailed step-by-step instructions for emulating this technique in a test environment are available. However, organizations can develop scenarios based on the technical context provided.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential exfiltration via containers:
- Investigate the container orchestration logs to identify unauthorized activities.
- Analyze network traffic for unusual patterns or connections.
- Review access and modification records of code repositories associated with the alerts.
- Implement immediate containment measures, such as isolating affected containers.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references are available. Organizations should consider consulting documentation specific to their container orchestration platforms and security tools for more tailored guidance.
