# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Application Access Tokens

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using application access tokens in cloud environments like Office 365, SaaS platforms, and Google Workspace.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1550.001 - Application Access Token
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Office 365, SaaS, Google Workspace

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing access patterns to detect unauthorized use of application access tokens. Key data sources include logs from cloud service providers, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Anomalous login times or locations for user accounts.
- Unusual activity following token acquisition.
- Changes in permissions without typical administrative approval processes.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use compromised credentials to acquire application access tokens, granting them the ability to move laterally within a network undetected. They might leverage these tokens to execute commands as if they were legitimate users, bypassing traditional security measures.

### Adversary Emulation Details
While specific adversary emulation scenarios are not detailed here, adversaries may perform actions such as:
- Using compromised credentials to obtain application access tokens.
- Modifying token permissions for broader access.
- Executing tasks or accessing data using the elevated privileges granted by these tokens.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection is limited to scenarios where token usage patterns deviate significantly from baseline behavior, potentially missing subtle misuse.
  - Limited visibility into actions performed within secured environments that do not generate logs or events.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes a well-established baseline of normal user and application behavior for anomaly detection.
  - Relies on comprehensive logging by cloud service providers and integration with SIEM systems.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of tokens during off-hours or from new locations due to travel or remote work policies.
- Authorized changes in permissions as part of routine administrative tasks.
- Automated scripts or scheduled tasks using application access tokens for legitimate purposes.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The misuse of application access tokens can lead to significant lateral movement within a network, potentially resulting in data exfiltration or further compromise. This technique allows adversaries to evade detection by masquerading as legitimate users, making it critical to detect and mitigate promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are not available.

## Response
Guidelines for analysts when the alert fires:
1. **Initial Assessment:**
   - Review logs related to the suspicious token usage.
   - Determine if the activity correlates with known business processes or scheduled tasks.

2. **Containment:**
   - Revoke access tokens associated with the suspicious activity immediately.
   - Isolate affected accounts and systems from the network.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze user behavior prior to token acquisition.
   - Examine changes in permissions or configurations linked to the account.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Reset compromised credentials and tokens.
   - Strengthen access controls and review administrative processes.

5. **Communication:**
   - Document findings and communicate with relevant stakeholders.
   - Update incident response plans based on lessons learned.
