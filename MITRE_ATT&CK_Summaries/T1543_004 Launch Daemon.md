# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Launch Daemon - macOS

## Goal
The aim of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to leverage launch daemons for persistence and privilege escalation on macOS systems. By focusing on the misuse of launch daemons, we can detect unauthorized activities that allow adversaries to maintain access or elevate privileges within a target environment.

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy for launch daemons involves monitoring and analyzing various data sources such as system logs, configuration files, and process activity. Patterns indicative of unauthorized or malicious changes to launch daemons are identified, including:
- Creation or modification of plist files in `/Library/LaunchDaemons` or `~/Library/LaunchAgents`.
- Execution of suspicious binaries through these launch points.
- Unusual scheduling patterns or persistence behaviors associated with launch agents/daemons.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit macOS's launch daemons to achieve persistence and privilege escalation. Launch daemons are used to automatically execute scripts or applications at boot time, login events, or scheduled intervals. Attackers can place malicious plist files in the system directories (`/Library/LaunchDaemons` or `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons`) or user directories (`~/Library/LaunchAgents`), allowing them to run unauthorized processes with elevated privileges.

In practice, adversaries might use tools like `launchctl` to load these daemons without proper authorization. For instance:
- Command: `sudo launchctl load /path/to/malicious.plist`
- Adversaries may also modify existing plist files to execute their payloads or drop additional malicious components during system startup or user login.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** This detection strategy might not cover all scenarios where adversaries use alternative persistence mechanisms that don't rely on launch daemons. Additionally, sophisticated attackers may employ obfuscation techniques to bypass detection.
- **Assumptions:** The system's logging and monitoring tools are correctly configured and operational. It is also assumed that there are no significant policy changes affecting the default behavior of macOS security features.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software installations or updates using launch daemons for configuration purposes.
- System administrators performing authorized maintenance tasks involving plist files.
- Development environments where scripts and applications use launch agents/daemons for testing purposes.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The exploitation of launch daemons can provide adversaries with persistent access and elevated privileges, making it a critical security concern. Detecting such activities is essential to maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of macOS systems within an organization.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

### Launch Daemon
1. **Create a Malicious Plist File:**
   ```bash
   cat << EOF > /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.example.malicious.plist
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>com.example.malicious</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
         <string>/bin/bash</string>
         <string>-c</string>
         <string>echo "Malicious activity" > /tmp/malicious_output.txt</string>
       </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
     </dict>
   </plist>
   EOF
   ```

2. **Load the Daemon:**
   ```bash
   sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.example.malicious.plist
   ```

3. **Verify Execution:**
   Check for the presence of `/tmp/malicious_output.txt` to confirm that the malicious activity was executed.

### Launch Daemon - Users Directory
1. **Create a Malicious Plist File in User's Directory:**
   ```bash
   cat << EOF > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.usermalicious.plist
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
   <plist version="1.0">
     <dict>
       <key>Label</key>
       <string>com.example.usermalicious</string>
       <key>ProgramArguments</key>
       <array>
         <string>/bin/bash</string>
         <string>-c</string>
         <string>echo "User-level malicious activity" > ~/malicious_output.txt</string>
       </array>
       <key>RunAtLoad</key>
       <true/>
     </dict>
   </plist>
   EOF
   ```

2. **Load the Agent:**
   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.usermalicious.plist
   ```

3. **Verify Execution:**
   Check for the presence of `~/malicious_output.txt` to confirm that the malicious activity was executed at user login.

## Response
When an alert related to unauthorized launch daemon activities fires, analysts should:
1. Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further compromise.
2. Investigate the origin and nature of the plist files involved (e.g., creation date, associated processes).
3. Determine if any sensitive data has been accessed or exfiltrated by reviewing logs and file access records.
4. Remove malicious plist files and unload the corresponding daemons/agents using `launchctl`.
5. Conduct a thorough system scan for additional malware or persistence mechanisms.
6. Review user accounts and permissions to identify potential privilege escalation vectors.
