# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technology. This includes adversaries using containers to obscure malicious activities, evade detection systems, or maintain persistence in a compromised environment.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1597 - Search Closed Sources
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Execution)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous behaviors associated with the use of containers that could indicate adversarial activities. Data sources analyzed include:
- Container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- System event logs from container runtimes (e.g., Docker, rkt)
- Network traffic monitoring data
- User and entity behavior analytics

Patterns to be analyzed involve unusual image pull requests, unexpected creation of containers, abnormal resource usage spikes within containers, and anomalous network communications initiated by containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers for their flexibility and ease of deployment. They often use containers to encapsulate malicious payloads, making detection more challenging due to the ephemeral nature of containerized environments. Real-world execution might involve adversaries deploying containers with pre-built images containing malware or using containers as a stepping stone for lateral movement.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - `docker run --rm -it --net=host malicious_image`
  - `kubectl create deployment --image=malicious_image exploit-deploy`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:
- Incomplete visibility into all container orchestration platforms.
- Difficulty distinguishing between legitimate high-volume container operations (e.g., CI/CD pipelines) and adversarial activities.
- Assumption that all containers are managed through a central logging system.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate development or testing activities using containers extensively.
- Automated deployments in CI/CD environments resulting in frequent container creation and destruction.
- Misconfigured containers leading to unusual resource usage patterns.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
Justification: The use of containers by adversaries represents a significant threat due to their ability to bypass traditional security measures, exploit isolated environments, and facilitate rapid deployment of malicious payloads. This strategy is crucial in modern environments where containerized applications are prevalent.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no adversary emulation scenarios or step-by-step instructions are available for this technique. Developing these would involve setting up controlled test environments with various container platforms to simulate adversarial behaviors and validate detection effectiveness.

## Response
When the alert fires:
1. **Verify Alert:** Confirm if the detected behavior is part of a known legitimate operation.
2. **Investigate Container Logs:** Examine logs for unusual activities such as unexpected image pulls or commands executed within containers.
3. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network traffic to determine if there are any suspicious communications initiated by the container.
4. **Contain and Isolate:** If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate affected containers from the network and stop their execution.
5. **Forensic Investigation:** Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the container environment to understand the scope of the compromise.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available for this ADS report. Further development could include collaboration with cybersecurity communities to gather more insights into emerging adversarial tactics involving containers.
