# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: T1547.013 - XDG Autostart Entries

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to leverage XDG autostart entries on Linux systems for persistence and privilege escalation. By exploiting these autostart mechanisms, adversaries can ensure their malicious applications execute automatically upon user login or system startup.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1547.013 - XDG Autostart Entries
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** 
  - Persistence: Establishing and maintaining access to the network.
  - Privilege Escalation: Increasing the level of privileges on a system.
- **Platforms:** Linux

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring changes within the autostart directories and files, specifically targeting `~/.config/autostart` and `/etc/xdg/autostart`. Key patterns include:

- **Creation of new `.desktop` files:** Monitoring for unexpected or unauthorized creation of new desktop entry files.
- **Modification to existing `.desktop` files:** Detecting changes in the contents or permissions of current autostart entries that may indicate tampering.
  
Data sources include:
- File integrity monitoring (FIM) tools
- Audit logs capturing file and directory access events

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit XDG autostart to gain persistent access by inserting malicious scripts into `.desktop` files within the autostart directories. These entries are executed when users log in, allowing adversaries to maintain a foothold on the system.

### Real-World Execution
An adversary may craft a custom `.desktop` file with execution permissions and place it in one of the autostart directories:

```bash
cat <<EOF > ~/.config/autostart/malicious_app.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=MALICIOUS_APP
Exec=/path/to/malicious/script.sh
Hidden=false
NoDisplay=false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
EOF

chmod +x ~/.config/autostart/malicious_app.desktop
```

### Adversary Emulation Details
To emulate this technique in a controlled environment, an analyst can follow these steps:

1. Create a test `.desktop` file with benign content.
2. Set appropriate permissions to ensure execution upon login.
3. Verify the autostart entry triggers as expected.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Assumption:** The monitoring system has comprehensive access to relevant directories and can interpret changes accurately.
- **Blind Spot:** Detection might miss obfuscated or encoded scripts embedded within legitimate applications' `.desktop` files that are already present in the autostart directory.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:

- Users setting up their own autostart entries for personal applications.
- Legitimate software installations automatically creating necessary autostart files, such as system services or user applications requiring startup permissions.

Care must be taken to distinguish between normal and suspicious activities by cross-referencing with whitelisted applications and known-good configurations.

## Priority
**High:** Given the potential for adversaries to achieve persistent access and escalate privileges via this technique, it is critical to detect and mitigate attempts promptly. This method can be leveraged to maintain long-term control over compromised systems without immediate detection.

## Response

When an alert triggers indicating a change in autostart entries:

1. **Verify the Change:** 
   - Confirm if the new or modified entry corresponds with any legitimate application installations.
   - Check for recent user actions that may explain changes (e.g., software installation).

2. **Investigate Origin:**
   - Trace back system logs to determine who initiated the change and when it occurred.

3. **Quarantine & Remediate:**
   - Temporarily disable the suspicious autostart entry.
   - Remove or revert any unauthorized changes and restore from a known-good configuration if necessary.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Strengthen file integrity checks on autostart directories.
   - Increase alert sensitivity for future changes in these locations, especially if frequent legitimate modifications are common.

5. **User Awareness:**
   - Inform users about the risks associated with modifying autostart entries and encourage secure practices.
