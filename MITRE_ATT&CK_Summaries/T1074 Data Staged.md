# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by utilizing containers. The focus is on detecting activities where adversaries stage data within containerized environments, potentially evading traditional host-based monitoring techniques.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1074 - Data Staged
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection
- **Platforms:** Windows, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), Linux, macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages both host and container-level data sources to identify anomalous patterns indicative of adversaries staging data within containers. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Network traffic logs between the container and external endpoints
- System call traces from within the container

Patterns analyzed encompass unexpected or large volumes of data transfers between a container and external systems, creation of suspicious network connections, and unusual file operations indicating data staging.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to bypass security controls by isolating their activities within ephemeral environments that are less scrutinized than traditional hosts. Containers can facilitate rapid deployment, movement, and concealment of malicious payloads or exfiltrated data without triggering host-based detection mechanisms.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries might deploy a container to stage data for extraction. They may use commands such as `docker run` with specific options to limit logging or restrict network access to evade monitoring. Test scenarios can involve running containers that perform unexpected volume transfers or connect to external IPs known for malicious activity.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- The strategy assumes a baseline understanding of normal container usage patterns within the environment.
- Detection may not fully cover all evasion techniques, such as sophisticated use of ephemeral container lifecycles to avoid logging.
- There might be gaps in detecting activities conducted entirely within containers if host-based monitoring is insufficiently integrated.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate data staging for backup or synchronization purposes.
- Use of containers for development and testing environments where high-volume data transfer is expected.
- Automated scripts or DevOps processes involving container orchestration tools like Kubernetes performing routine operations.

## Priority
**High:** The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers represents a significant threat. Containers are increasingly popular in modern IT environments, making them attractive targets for adversaries seeking to evade detection.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential adversarial activity within a container fires:

1. **Investigate the Container:** Examine the specific container identified by the alert for any suspicious processes or files.
2. **Analyze Network Traffic:** Review network logs to identify unusual data transfers or connections initiated by the container.
3. **Review Logs and Metrics:** Cross-reference container runtime logs, system calls, and other telemetry data for additional context.
4. **Containment Actions:** If malicious activity is confirmed, isolate the affected container from the network and halt its operations.
5. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the scope of the compromise and identify any lateral movement within the environment.

- Case studies on container-based attacks and defenses.
- Tools and frameworks for monitoring containerized environments effectively.

This detection strategy provides a framework for identifying adversarial attempts to use containers as an evasion technique, enhancing overall security posture against sophisticated threats.
