# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## **Goal**

The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging containers. This involves identifying activities where adversaries use containerization technology to mask malicious actions from detection mechanisms.

## **Categorization**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1588.006 - Vulnerabilities
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Environment)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/006)

## **Strategy Abstract**

The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container activities to identify suspicious patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration platform logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) alerts
- Network traffic analysis between containers

Patterns analyzed involve unusual network communications, unexpected changes in container configurations, and deviations from normal runtime behaviors.

## **Technical Context**

Adversaries exploit container vulnerabilities to execute malicious payloads without triggering traditional security controls. They may:

- Deploy malware within containers to maintain persistence.
- Use containers as a pivot point for lateral movement across the network.
- Exfiltrate data by embedding it in container images or using inter-container communications.

Real-world execution involves adversaries leveraging misconfigurations, such as insecure defaults or insufficient isolation between containers, to execute their payloads undetected.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique:

1. Set up a vulnerable container environment with weak security policies.
2. Deploy a benign application that mimics suspicious behavior (e.g., excessive network communication).
3. Monitor for detection triggers such as unusual API calls or altered configurations.

Sample command:
```bash
docker run -d --name test-container --network host my-malicious-app
```

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**

- Assumes a robust baseline of normal container behavior is established.
- Relies on accurate logging from all components, which may not always be configured correctly.
- May miss detection if adversaries use advanced evasion techniques like steganography within container images.

## **False Positives**

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate applications with high network usage or frequent configuration changes.
- System updates or maintenance tasks executed via containers.
- Misconfigured but non-malicious automated scripts running inside containers.

## **Priority**

**Severity: High**

Justification:
- Containers are increasingly used in modern infrastructures, making them a valuable target for adversaries.
- The ability to bypass traditional security monitoring can lead to significant undetected breaches and data exfiltration.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**

Currently, no standardized step-by-step instructions are available. However, organizations should:

1. Create a controlled test environment mimicking production container setups.
2. Introduce known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations deliberately.
3. Execute benign applications designed to exhibit suspicious behaviors for detection validation.

## **Response**

When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. Immediately isolate affected containers and networks to prevent further spread.
2. Conduct a detailed investigation into recent container activities and configurations.
3. Review logs for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
4. Update security policies and patches to address identified vulnerabilities.

## **Additional Resources**

- No additional resources currently available.
