# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to establish bidirectional communication channels using containers as a method to bypass security monitoring.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1102.002 - Bidirectional Communication
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages network traffic analysis to monitor for anomalous patterns indicative of bidirectional communication channels established via containerization technologies. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic Logs:** Analyze incoming and outgoing packets from known containers.
- **Container Activity Logs:** Monitor for unusual start-up commands, resource usage spikes, or unexpected inter-container communications.
- **Process Monitoring Data:** Detect abnormal process behaviors such as spawning new processes inside a container.

Patterns analyzed will focus on identifying irregular network traffic patterns, unexpected container activity, and anomalous process interactions that align with the characteristics of T1102.002.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit containers for establishing covert communication channels due to their lightweight nature and ability to bypass traditional security controls. In real-world scenarios:

- **Container Orchestration Tools:** Adversaries may use tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Apache Mesos to orchestrate malicious containers.
- **Communication Protocols:** Encrypted protocols such as TLS/SSL are often used to obscure traffic.
- **Dynamic Port Allocation:** Attackers might use ephemeral ports and dynamic hostnames to avoid detection.

### Adversary Emulation Details
While specific adversary emulation details are not available, test scenarios could involve setting up a controlled environment with container orchestration platforms to simulate suspicious activities such as:

1. Creating containers with network interfaces that communicate over unexpected ports.
2. Simulating inter-container communication using encrypted channels.
3. Monitoring for unusual spikes in resource usage or process spawning within containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss sophisticated adversaries who use advanced evasion techniques, such as traffic obfuscation or mimicking legitimate application behavior.
  - Zero-day vulnerabilities in container management software could be exploited without detection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - It is assumed that baseline network and process activity patterns are well-established for effective anomaly detection.
  - The security infrastructure has comprehensive visibility into all containerized workloads.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers for development or testing purposes, leading to unusual but harmless network traffic patterns.
- Temporary spikes in resource usage due to legitimate workload increases.
- Authorized inter-container communication within a microservices architecture using encrypted protocols.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
Bidirectional communication through containers can significantly undermine an organization's security posture by enabling adversaries to control compromised systems remotely and exfiltrate sensitive data. The stealthy nature of such communications makes them particularly dangerous, warranting high priority for detection and response.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Anomalies:** Confirm that detected activities are not part of planned or authorized operations.
2. **Isolate Affected Systems:** Temporarily restrict network access to affected containers to prevent potential data exfiltration or further compromise.
3. **Investigate Logs:** Review container activity logs and process monitoring data for additional indicators of malicious behavior.
4. **Coordinate with Development Teams:** If legitimate activities are identified, work with development teams to adjust baseline patterns or update detection rules.
5. **Update Security Measures:** Enhance security controls around containerized environments, such as implementing stricter network segmentation and access controls.

## Additional Resources
No additional references or context is available at this time. Analysts are encouraged to stay informed about emerging threats related to containerization technologies through industry reports and cybersecurity forums.
