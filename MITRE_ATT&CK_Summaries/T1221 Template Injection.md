# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Windows Template Injection

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify and prevent adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the exploitation of Windows template injection vulnerabilities. This technique specifically focuses on detecting attacks where adversaries use Word or other Microsoft Office templates as a vector for code execution, thereby evading traditional security controls.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1221 - Template Injection
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages various data sources, including endpoint monitoring logs, network traffic analysis, and user activity records. By identifying patterns such as unusual template loading activities or unexpected process interactions associated with Microsoft Office applications (e.g., Word, Excel), the strategy aims to detect potential exploitation attempts.

Key indicators include:
- Unusual creation of templates by non-administrative users.
- Execution of scripts or macros from templates atypical for a user's normal behavior profile.
- Network traffic anomalies involving known malicious IP addresses when launching Office applications.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit template injection vulnerabilities to execute code on Windows systems, often bypassing security measures such as antivirus software. This is achieved by embedding malicious payloads within document templates used by Microsoft Office applications. When a user opens or interacts with these documents, the payload can execute without triggering traditional file-based detection mechanisms.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Command:**
  ```powershell
  cscript.exe /nologo <path>\template.vbs
  ```

This command might be used by adversaries to execute a VBS script embedded within a Word template, exploiting the vulnerability.

### Test Scenarios
1. Create a benign Office template and monitor for legitimate usage patterns.
2. Inject a mock payload into the template using known exploitation techniques (e.g., embedding scripts).
3. Execute the manipulated template in a controlled environment to observe behavior and trigger conditions that align with detection logic.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may not cover highly obfuscated or polymorphic payloads.
  - Template-based attacks using zero-day vulnerabilities might evade detection until signatures are updated.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment has monitoring tools in place capable of capturing the relevant data sources (e.g., endpoint logs, network traffic).
  - Baselines for normal user behavior are established to accurately identify anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of templates by administrative users for automation purposes.
- Scheduled tasks or scripts interacting with Office applications in a manner similar to the exploitation pattern but intended for legitimate workflows.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Template injection is a sophisticated technique used primarily by advanced threat actors to evade detection. Its potential impact on organizational security, especially when combined with other evasion tactics, makes it a high-priority threat.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### WINWORD Remote Template Injection

1. **Setup Environment:** 
   - Deploy Microsoft Word on a Windows machine.
   - Ensure logging is enabled for user actions and application behaviors.

2. **Prepare the Malicious Template:**
   - Create an Office template with embedded macros or scripts designed to execute upon loading in Word.

3. **Emulate Attack:**
   - Use a script or command line tool to trigger the execution of the malicious template.
   - Example PowerShell command:
     ```powershell
     winword.exe /msother /r <path>\malicious_template.dotx
     ```

4. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Observe endpoint logs for signs of unusual template usage or script execution.
   - Verify network traffic for any unexpected outbound connections initiated by Word.

5. **Review Alerts:**
   - Ensure that the detection logic correctly identifies the malicious activity without being triggered by normal user interactions with templates.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent lateral movement.
2. **Investigation:** Review logs and alerts to confirm the presence of malicious activity.
3. **Eradication:** Remove or disable the malicious template and any associated scripts.
4. **Recovery:** Restore affected systems from clean backups if necessary, ensuring no residual artifacts remain.
5. **Post-Incident Analysis:** Update detection signatures based on findings and adjust monitoring thresholds to reduce false positives.
