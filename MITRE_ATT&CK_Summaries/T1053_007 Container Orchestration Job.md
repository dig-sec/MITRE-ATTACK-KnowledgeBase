# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Container Orchestration Job (T1053.007)

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that leverage container orchestration jobs as a means to bypass traditional security monitoring tools and achieve malicious objectives, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement within an environment.

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy focuses on monitoring container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, for suspicious activities. The data sources include logs from Kubernetes API servers, etcd databases, and orchestrator node components. Patterns analyzed encompass unusual job creation frequencies, unauthorized namespace usage, or anomalous resource allocation requests that could indicate adversarial behavior.

The strategy employs behavioral analytics to establish a baseline of normal orchestration activity, enabling the detection of deviations indicative of malicious actions.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit container orchestration platforms by deploying jobs that execute arbitrary code or maintain persistence. In real-world scenarios, attackers can use compromised credentials to create cron jobs within Kubernetes that run at intervals, providing continuous access to an environment.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `kubectl create cronjob` for creating periodic tasks.
  - Manipulating RBAC policies to grant excessive permissions to a compromised account.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

1. **Blind Spots:**
   - Detection may miss sophisticated attacks that use legitimate workloads to mask malicious activities.
   - Encrypted traffic within containers can obfuscate command-line arguments, hindering pattern detection.

2. **Assumptions:**
   - Assumes a baseline of "normal" activity is established and maintained for accurate anomaly detection.
   - Relies on timely updates to threat intelligence feeds to recognize new attack vectors.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate scheduled tasks (e.g., backups or maintenance jobs) that follow similar patterns as malicious cron jobs.
- Developer testing environments where frequent changes in job configurations are expected.
- Automated scaling operations that may create temporary resource spikes mimicking adversarial behavior.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification: Container orchestration platforms often manage critical applications and sensitive data. Exploitation of these systems can lead to significant security breaches, including data exfiltration and loss of control over the infrastructure.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **ListCronjobs**
   - Command: `kubectl get cronjobs`
   - Objective: Identify existing cron jobs in the cluster for baseline comparison.

2. **CreateCronjob**
   - Command:
     ```bash
     kubectl create cronjob example-cron --image=alpine --schedule="*/5 * * * *" -- /bin/sh -c "echo 'Hello from the Kubernetes cluster'"
     ```
   - Objective: Simulate an adversary creating a job that executes every 5 minutes to test detection mechanisms.

## Response

When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm the legitimacy of the detected orchestration job by reviewing its purpose and origin.
2. **Investigate:** Examine associated logs for any unauthorized access or abnormal behavior patterns.
3. **Containment:** Temporarily suspend suspicious jobs to prevent potential damage while further analysis is conducted.
4. **Remediation:** Remove unauthorized jobs and assess whether the underlying issue (e.g., compromised credentials) has been resolved.
