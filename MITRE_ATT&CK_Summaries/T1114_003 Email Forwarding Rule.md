# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Email Forwarding Rule Manipulation

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to manipulate email forwarding rules within enterprise environments such as Office 365, Windows, Google Workspace, macOS, and Linux. This detection aims to identify unauthorized or suspicious configuration changes that could facilitate data exfiltration.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of security information and event management (SIEM) tools, email gateway logs, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems to monitor for unauthorized changes in email forwarding rules. Key data sources include:
- Email service logs from Office 365 and Google Workspace.
- Event logs from Windows operating systems.
- User activity monitoring on macOS and Linux.

Patterns analyzed involve unexpected or unauthorized rule modifications and anomalies in account activities that typically access email configuration settings.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may manipulate email forwarding rules to bypass security controls and exfiltrate sensitive information. This can be executed by:
1. Gaining administrative access through phishing or credential theft.
2. Altering mail server configurations or using built-in user interfaces for rule management.
3. Deploying scripts that automate the configuration of forwarding rules.

Adversary emulation details might include commands such as PowerShell scripts on Windows to alter registry settings related to email configurations, or command-line tools on macOS/Linux like `mail` and `msmtp`.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss rule changes made through zero-day vulnerabilities that bypass existing monitoring.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes users with administrative privileges are trustworthy unless explicitly flagged by other detection mechanisms.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities could include:
- Authorized IT personnel performing routine maintenance or updates on email servers.
- Legitimate configuration changes made for business process improvements.
- Automated scripts running as part of scheduled tasks that have been authorized and documented.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
Justification: Email forwarding rule manipulation is a significant vector for data exfiltration, allowing adversaries to siphon off sensitive information without direct detection. The impact can be extensive, affecting confidentiality and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Office 365 - Email Forwarding
1. **Set Up Test Environment:** Create an isolated Office 365 tenant for testing purposes.
2. **Simulate User Account Access:**
   - Log in as a user with sufficient permissions to change email settings.
3. **Modify Email Forwarding Rule:**
   - Navigate to the “Mail” app and select “Forwarding.”
   - Set up a rule to forward emails from a test account to an external address.
4. **Log Activity:** Ensure that logs capture this activity, paying special attention to audit trails in Office 365 Admin Center.
5. **Verify Detection:**
   - Check if the monitoring system triggers alerts based on the configuration change.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Investigate Source:** Determine whether the rule modification was initiated by a legitimate user or an unauthorized entity.
2. **Analyze Context:** Review associated logs for suspicious patterns, such as logins from unusual locations or times.
3. **Revert Changes:** Immediately revert any unauthorized forwarding rules to their original state.
4. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Enforce stricter access controls and review permissions regularly.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
