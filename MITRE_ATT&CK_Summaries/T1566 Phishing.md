# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containerization technologies. Attackers use containers to isolate malicious activities, evade detection tools, and execute payloads with reduced visibility.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous behaviors related to container usage that suggest evasion attempts. The data sources include logs from container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS), and endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. Patterns analyzed involve unusual network traffic, unauthorized access to container management interfaces, and atypical processes running within containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containerization by setting up isolated environments where they can execute malicious payloads undetected by traditional security solutions. They may utilize container escape techniques or leverage misconfigurations in orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to gain elevated privileges and deploy further attacks. Adversary emulation details include deploying containers with unusual metadata, unauthorized access attempts to the Docker daemon socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`), and unexpected image pull requests.

### Sample Commands for Emulation:
- Running a container from an unknown base image: `docker run -d --name test_container unknown_image`
- Accessing the Docker socket: `nc -U /var/run/docker.sock`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss sophisticated techniques that mimic legitimate traffic patterns or use encrypted channels to bypass monitoring tools.
- **Assumptions:** It assumes that baseline behaviors for container usage are well-established, which might not hold true in highly dynamic environments.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate deployments of microservices using containers.
- Routine updates or maintenance activities involving container images and orchestration platforms.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Given the increasing adoption of containerized environments across industries, adversaries are likely to exploit them for evasion. The potential impact includes undetected execution of malicious payloads and lateral movement within an organization's network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no validated adversary emulation steps are available for this technique.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. Verify the legitimacy of container-related activities by cross-referencing with known operational schedules.
2. Investigate the source and nature of any unauthorized access attempts to container management interfaces.
3. Analyze network traffic patterns associated with the containers for signs of exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
4. Isolate affected containers and conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs).
5. Update detection rules based on findings to reduce future false positives.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references are available. Further research into container security best practices and threat intelligence is recommended for enhancing this strategy.
