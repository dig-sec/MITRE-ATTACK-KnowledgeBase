# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to evade security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. Specifically, it focuses on detecting when adversaries use containers as a means of obfuscation or to maintain persistence within an environment without being detected.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1591.004 - Identify Roles  
  This technique is mapped to MITRE's "Identify Roles" under the ATT&CK framework, indicating adversaries' efforts to identify and assign roles for their attack infrastructure.
  
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance  
  The tactic aligns with the reconnaissance phase of an adversary's kill chain, as it involves gathering information about the environment before executing further malicious activities.

- **Platforms:** PRE (Preparation)  
  During this stage, adversaries prepare their attack infrastructure by setting up containers to conceal their presence and operations.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy utilizes a combination of log analysis, network traffic monitoring, and container-specific metadata inspection. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration platform logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs)
- Network traffic patterns associated with container communication
- System-level events related to container lifecycle management

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Anomalous creation or modification of containers by unauthorized users.
- Unusual network flows between containers and external hosts, especially those targeting sensitive internal resources.
- Sudden spikes in resource usage indicative of hidden malicious activities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers due to their lightweight nature and ability to be easily spun up or torn down, making them ideal for short-term evasion. Common tactics include:
- Deploying a container with obfuscated payloads to maintain persistence while avoiding detection by traditional endpoint security tools.
- Leveraging legitimate container orchestration platforms (e.g., Docker Swarm, Kubernetes) to blend in with normal operations.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
To emulate this technique, adversaries might execute commands such as:
```bash
docker run -d --name malicious_container -v /mnt/data:/data eviluser/malicious_image
```
This command runs a container named `malicious_container` from an image designed to carry out unauthorized activities while mounting a host directory for data persistence.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** Detection might miss well-crafted, low-profile containers that mimic legitimate traffic patterns.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes robust logging is enabled on container platforms and network devices. Without detailed logs, subtle malicious activities could go unnoticed.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate automated scripts or DevOps processes creating containers as part of normal operations.
- Temporary resource spikes due to legitimate high-demand applications running in containers.

To minimize false positives, it is crucial to establish baseline behavior patterns for container usage within the environment and configure alert thresholds accordingly.

## Priority
**Severity: High**
Justification:
The use of containers for adversarial purposes represents a significant threat as they can facilitate rapid evasion and persistence. Given the increasing adoption of containerized environments across organizations, addressing this vector is critical to maintaining security posture.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no step-by-step instructions are available within this report. However, setting up a controlled test environment using common orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm can help validate detection effectiveness by simulating adversarial container activities.

## Response
When an alert for suspicious container activity fires:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected containers and associated network segments.
2. **Investigation:** Analyze container logs, inspect running processes, and review recent changes to configurations or permissions.
3. **Mitigation:** Remove unauthorized containers, revoke any rogue user accounts, and update security controls (e.g., tighten RBAC policies).
4. **Post-Incident Review:** Conduct a thorough post-incident analysis to identify root causes and improve detection capabilities.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources or references are available within this report. However, organizations should consult their container platform's official documentation for best practices on security monitoring and incident response specific to containerized environments.
