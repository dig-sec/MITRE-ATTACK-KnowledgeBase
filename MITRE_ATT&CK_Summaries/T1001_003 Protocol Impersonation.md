# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

---

## Goal

The aim of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using containerization technologies. This involves adversaries leveraging containers as a means to mask malicious activities and evade traditional detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring container activity across multiple data sources including network traffic logs, system event logs, and application logs. Key patterns analyzed include unusual or unauthorized container image pulls, unexpected changes in container runtime configurations, and anomalous communication between containers and external IPs. By correlating this information, security systems can identify suspicious behaviors indicative of evasion attempts.

---

## Technical Context

Adversaries often exploit the flexibility and lightweight nature of containers to deploy malicious payloads that are difficult to detect using traditional endpoint security solutions. In practice, adversaries might use popular container platforms such as Docker or Kubernetes to execute these activities. Sample commands used by adversaries include:

- **Docker**: `docker pull <malicious_image>` followed by `docker run -d --name <container_name> <malicious_image>`
- **Kubernetes**: Using YAML files for deployment that contain obfuscated malicious containers.

Adversary emulation scenarios may involve setting up a benign container environment and injecting a container image designed to mimic known adversary behaviors, such as establishing C2 communications via common ports or altering container runtime configurations to avoid detection.

---

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection might be limited for containers deployed in air-gapped environments where network monitoring is not feasible.
  - Encrypted traffic between containers can obscure malicious activity if decryption is not supported by the security tools.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that baseline behaviors of container usage are well-understood and documented within the organization's environment.
  - Relies on having comprehensive visibility into all deployed container orchestrators and registries.

---

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers for development and testing, where frequent image pulls or configuration changes are normal.
- Automated CI/CD pipelines that regularly spin up containers as part of software deployment processes.

---

## Priority

**Priority Level: High**

Justification:
Container-based attacks present a significant challenge due to their ability to evade traditional endpoint defenses. Given the increasing adoption of container technologies in enterprise environments, the potential impact and sophistication of such attacks warrant high priority for detection efforts.

---

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, there are no specific instructions available for adversary emulation within this strategy framework.

---

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected container(s) to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Collect and preserve logs from the network, host, and application layers for further analysis.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze the behavior of the suspicious container image and its interactions with other systems.
   - Compare the identified activities against known indicators of compromise (IoCs) to confirm malicious intent.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove or quarantine any compromised containers and associated images from all environments.
   - Update detection rules if new patterns or evasion techniques are discovered during the investigation.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of container security policies and practices to identify and mitigate future risks.
   - Educate relevant teams on the findings and update incident response protocols accordingly.
