# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts aimed at bypassing security monitoring systems using containers. This involves identifying strategies used by adversaries to conceal malicious activities within containerized environments.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous behaviors and patterns associated with container usage that could indicate attempts to bypass security monitoring. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Monitoring for unusual log entries or activities that deviate from normal operational baselines.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identifying unexpected outbound communications or data exfiltration attempts.
- **System Calls and Resource Utilization:** Detecting anomalous usage patterns that could suggest hidden operations within containers.

Patterns to be analyzed include:

- Unusual container start-up/shutdown sequences.
- Suspicious network traffic originating from containerized environments.
- Atypical system calls indicating potential privilege escalation or covert activities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to execute malicious code while evading traditional security monitoring mechanisms. Containers offer a lightweight, isolated environment that can be leveraged for executing botnets or other unauthorized tasks without detection.

**Real-world Execution:**
- Adversaries might deploy containers with modified images containing malicious payloads.
- They could exploit container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to scale these operations stealthily.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
Example Command:
```bash
docker run --rm -d mymaliciousimage sh -c 'sleep 3600'
```
This command runs a Docker container from an image named `mymaliciousimage` that executes the sleep command for one hour, simulating benign activity while potentially conducting malicious operations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss highly sophisticated evasion techniques where adversaries use advanced obfuscation.
  - Containers running in environments with lax security controls might not generate detectable anomalies.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Baselines for normal container behavior are well-defined and maintained.
  - Security monitoring tools have visibility into the containerized environment's full scope.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate containers performing routine operations with high network activity (e.g., data backup processes).
- Automated testing environments using container technology, resulting in frequent start/stop cycles.
- Development environments where developers frequently spin up and tear down containers as part of their workflow.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification:
The ability to bypass security monitoring undetected poses a significant threat. Adversaries exploiting containers can scale malicious activities rapidly across an enterprise, potentially leading to severe data breaches or disruption of services.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Alert:** Confirm if there is legitimate container activity that matches the detected pattern.
2. **Investigate Anomalies:**
   - Analyze container logs and network traffic for signs of malicious behavior.
   - Check for unauthorized changes to container images or configurations.
3. **Contain Threats:**
   - Isolate affected containers to prevent further spread.
   - Disable suspicious containers if they are not part of approved operations.
4. **Mitigate Risk:**
   - Update security policies and baselines to improve detection accuracy.
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities for containerized environments.
