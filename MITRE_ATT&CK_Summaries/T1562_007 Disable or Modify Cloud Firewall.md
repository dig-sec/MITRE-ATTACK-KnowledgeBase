## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring key data sources such as cloud provider logs, container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), and network traffic. The focus is on identifying anomalies in firewall configurations or suspicious container behaviors indicative of attempts to disable or modify security settings.

### Data Sources:

- **Cloud Provider Logs:** These include API call logs from the cloud management console that may reveal changes to firewall rules.
- **Container Orchestrator Logs:** Such as Kubernetes audit logs, which can show pod creation and modification events.
- **Network Traffic:** Analyzed for unusual patterns like unexpected traffic flows or large data transfers between containers.

### Patterns Analyzed:

- Unexpected modifications to firewall rules or security group settings.
- Creation of new container instances without proper authorization.
- Anomalous network behavior emanating from known benign containers.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit the flexibility and dynamic nature of containerization environments to obscure their activities. They may use legitimate cloud management tools with elevated privileges to alter firewall configurations, allowing them to move laterally across the environment or exfiltrate data without detection.

### Real-World Execution:

- **API Abuse:** Using compromised credentials to call APIs that modify firewall settings.
- **Container Escalation:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in container orchestration platforms to gain control over containers and alter their behavior.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique, an adversary might perform actions such as:

1. Compromise a cloud service account with permissions to modify security groups or firewall rules.
2. Use Kubernetes API calls (e.g., `kubectl apply -f`) to deploy unauthorized pods designed to exploit network configurations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss highly sophisticated attacks that mimic legitimate traffic patterns closely. Also, reliance on logging completeness may overlook unlogged events due to misconfigurations.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes accurate logging of all API calls and container activities by cloud providers and orchestrators.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Authorized changes made by system administrators as part of routine maintenance or scaling operations.
- Legitimate testing environments where security policies are temporarily altered for development purposes.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

Justification: The ability to modify firewall settings can provide adversaries with unfettered access to cloud resources, facilitating further malicious activities such as data exfiltration and lateral movement across the network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no specific step-by-step emulation instructions are available. However, security teams should consider setting up a controlled test environment that mimics production to safely emulate potential adversarial actions using known cloud APIs and container orchestration commands.

## Response

Upon alert activation:

1. **Immediate Review:** Analysts should quickly review the changes to firewall configurations or suspicious container activities.
2. **Containment:** Temporarily restrict network access for affected containers or services until further investigation is complete.
3. **Investigation:** Analyze logs and correlate events with other security incidents to determine if a breach has occurred.
4. **Remediation:** Restore original firewall settings, revoke compromised credentials, and apply patches to any vulnerabilities exploited.

## Additional Resources

- Cloud provider documentation on securing API access and container orchestration platforms.
- Security best practices for cloud environments, including network segmentation and least privilege principles.

By implementing this strategy, organizations can enhance their defensive posture against sophisticated adversarial tactics that leverage the dynamic nature of modern IaaS environments.
