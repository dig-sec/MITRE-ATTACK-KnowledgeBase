# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting cloud instance metadata services to access sensitive information and credentials.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1552.005 - Cloud Instance Metadata API
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/005)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing cloud instance metadata service requests to identify unauthorized access attempts. The primary data sources include:
- Cloud provider logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs)
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems

Key patterns analyzed involve unusual access times or locations for metadata services, repeated failed access attempts, and anomalous user behaviors that deviate from the norm.

## Technical Context
Adversaries leverage cloud instance metadata services to extract sensitive information such as credentials. This is often executed by:
- Exploiting default permissions in IaaS environments.
- Using compromised credentials to request metadata service details.
  
In real-world scenarios, adversaries may use tools or scripts designed to automate the retrieval of metadata, potentially exfiltrating data such as SSH keys, API tokens, and user account details.

### Adversary Emulation Details
To emulate this technique:
1. **Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords**
   - Use PowerShell commands to query Azure Active Directory (AD) attributes for stored passwords.
2. **Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines**
   - Execute a curl command on an Azure VM to access the metadata service endpoint and retrieve credentials:
     ```bash
     curl http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://management.azure.com/
     ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover all cloud environments if logs are not integrated or parsed correctly.
  - Adversaries using advanced obfuscation techniques might evade detection.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The system assumes that metadata access patterns are well-understood and deviations can be flagged as suspicious.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks accessing metadata for maintenance or updates.
- Automated scripts running during scheduled operations without malicious intent.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

Justification: Unauthorized access to cloud instance metadata poses a significant risk as it can lead to credential theft and further lateral movement within the environment. The high severity is due to the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy in a test environment:

### Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords
1. Log into your Azure account with appropriate permissions.
2. Open PowerShell and use the following command to query user attributes:
   ```powershell
   Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId <user-object-id> | Select-Object DisplayName, UserPrincipalName
   ```
3. Monitor any unusual access patterns or attempts to retrieve sensitive information.

### Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines
1. Log into an Azure VM.
2. Execute the following curl command:
   ```bash
   curl http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=https://management.azure.com/
   ```
3. Analyze logs for unauthorized metadata access attempts.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
1. **Verify the Source:** Confirm whether the request originated from a legitimate source.
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine if any sensitive information was accessed or exfiltrated.
3. **Containment:** Disable compromised credentials and isolate affected systems.
4. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the scope of the breach.
5. **Remediation:** Implement necessary security controls to prevent recurrence, such as tightening permissions on metadata services.
