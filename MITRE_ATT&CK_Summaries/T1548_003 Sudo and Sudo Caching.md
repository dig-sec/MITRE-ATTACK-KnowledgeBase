# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that aim to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by leveraging containers and exploiting the `sudo` command's caching capabilities on Linux and macOS systems. This technique focuses specifically on detecting T1548.003, which involves Sudo and Sudo Caching.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** [T1548.003 - Sudo and Sudo Caching](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:**
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy involves monitoring the usage of `sudo` commands that could indicate attempts to exploit sudo caching for privilege escalation or defense evasion. The data sources primarily include system logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/secure`) and auditd logs where available. Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual frequency and timing of `sudo` executions.
- Attempts to modify `sudoers` file or cache settings (like extending cache timeout).
- Disabling tty_tickets, which could enable persistent sudo access without reauthentication.

## Technical Context
Adversaries might exploit `sudo` caching by:
1. Modifying the `/etc/sudoers` file to extend the default cache expiration time.
2. Disabling `tty_tickets`, allowing cached credentials to be reused across different terminal sessions.
3. Using containers as a sandbox to test these configurations without risking persistent access on production systems.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Modifying Sudo Cache Timeout:**
  ```bash
  echo 'Defaults timestamp_timeout=99999' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
  ```
- **Disabling TTY Tickets for Sudo Caching:**
  ```bash
  echo 'Defaults !requiretty' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection might miss instances where attackers use alternate means (e.g., direct root access) to bypass logging or monitoring.
- Assumes consistent log retention and auditing policies across environments.
- Relies on the accuracy and completeness of system logs.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks involving `sudo` modifications for maintenance purposes.
- Scripts or automation tools running with elevated privileges for scheduled tasks.
- Misconfigured sudo settings due to non-malicious oversight by administrators.

## Priority
**High**  
The potential impact of adversaries bypassing security monitoring through privileged escalation warrants a high priority. Such actions can lead to undetected persistence and lateral movement within the network, increasing the risk of significant data breaches or system compromise.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy in a test environment, follow these steps:

### Sudo Usage
1. Execute sudo commands to establish baseline normal behavior.
   ```bash
   sudo ls /root
   ```

### Sudo Usage (FreeBSD)
1. Similar testing on FreeBSD using `sudo`:
   ```sh
   sudo ls /root
   ```

### Unlimited Sudo Cache Timeout
1. Modify the sudo cache timeout to a high value (e.g., 99999 seconds).
   ```bash
   echo 'Defaults timestamp_timeout=99999' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
   ```

### Unlimited Sudo Cache Timeout (FreeBSD)
1. Apply the same modification on FreeBSD systems.

### Disable TTY Tickets for Sudo Caching
1. Disable tty_tickets in `/etc/sudoers`.
   ```bash
   echo 'Defaults !requiretty' | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers
   ```

### Disable TTY Tickets for Sudo Caching (FreeBSD)
1. Apply the same modification on FreeBSD systems.

## Response
When an alert indicating suspicious `sudo` activity fires:
- Immediately investigate the specific `sudo` commands executed, focusing on changes to `sudoers`.
- Verify if the activity was part of scheduled maintenance or legitimate administrative tasks.
- Assess potential impacts and consider revoking extended sudo privileges temporarily.
- Document the findings and adjust detection thresholds or rules as necessary.

## Additional Resources
No additional references are currently available. Continuous monitoring and updates to this strategy should incorporate new insights from threat intelligence sources and evolving best practices in security operations.
