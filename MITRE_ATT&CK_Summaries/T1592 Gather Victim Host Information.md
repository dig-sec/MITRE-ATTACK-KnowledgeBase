# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This detection technique aims to identify adversarial attempts to gather information about a victim host using container technologies. The focus is on detecting efforts that leverage containers to perform reconnaissance activities which could bypass traditional security monitoring systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1592 - Gather Victim Host Information
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Physical Reality Emulation)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container orchestration platforms and host systems for unusual activities indicative of reconnaissance. Key data sources include logs from container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker), system-level event logs, and network traffic associated with containers. Patterns analyzed may include unexpected container creations, probing network ports, accessing sensitive files on the host, or abnormal inter-container communications.

## Technical Context
Adversaries use containers to perform reconnaissance due to their lightweight nature and ability to isolate processes from the host OS while still interacting closely with it. They might execute scripts within a container that scan for open ports, enumerate system information, or collect metadata about the host environment. For instance, adversaries may deploy containers configured to access Docker APIs for inspecting running containers or use tools like `netstat` and `ps` to gather details.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker exec [container_id] netstat -tuln`
  - `docker inspect --format='{{.HostConfig.PortBindings}}' [container_name]`
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a container with elevated privileges to access host system details.
  - Monitor unauthorized attempts to create or deploy containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss reconnaissance activities conducted via encrypted channels or advanced evasion techniques that mimic legitimate traffic patterns.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes robust logging and monitoring of container platforms are in place, which might not be true for all environments.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate DevOps activities where developers inspect containers as part of their workflow.
- Routine security scans performed by IT teams that inadvertently mimic reconnaissance behaviors.
- Automated testing or deployment processes involving temporary or disposable containers.

## Priority
**Priority:** High  
Justification: Reconnaissance is a critical phase in adversarial operations, often preceding more severe actions such as exploitation or data exfiltration. Early detection of such activities can prevent further compromise and aid in threat intelligence gathering.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm if the detected activity aligns with known benign processes or is indicative of malicious intent.
2. **Containment:** If deemed malicious, isolate affected containers and host systems to prevent lateral movement.
3. **Forensics:** Collect logs and evidence for further investigation into the nature and origin of the activity.
4. **Communication:** Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT security teams and incident response units.
