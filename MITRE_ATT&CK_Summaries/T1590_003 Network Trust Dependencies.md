# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
Detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This technique aims to identify malicious actors who exploit containerization technologies to evade detection by traditional network and endpoint defenses.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1590.003 - Network Trust Dependencies
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Resources)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/003)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of network and host-based data sources to identify unusual patterns associated with container misuse. Key data sources include:
- **Container Orchestration Logs:** Analyzing Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or other orchestration tools for suspicious activities.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitoring for abnormal traffic patterns that may indicate attempts to bypass security controls.
- **System and Security Logs:** Reviewing logs from host systems for unauthorized container deployments or configurations.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual network connections initiated by containers.
- Unexpected changes in container configurations.
- Anomalies in resource usage that deviate from baseline behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers to bypass security monitoring by leveraging the inherent trust within containerized environments. They may use containers to execute commands or access resources without triggering traditional detection mechanisms. This can involve:
- Deploying malicious containers with elevated privileges.
- Exploiting misconfigurations in container orchestration platforms.
- Using containers as a proxy for command and control (C2) communications.

Adversary emulation details might include:
- Commands like `docker exec` to run processes within a compromised container.
- Misconfigured network policies that allow unrestricted access between containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not cover all methods of container exploitation, especially if adversaries use custom or less common container technologies.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that baseline behavior for legitimate container activity is well-defined and monitored.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate development environments using containers extensively.
- Misconfigurations in container orchestration platforms leading to unexpected network traffic.
- Scheduled tasks or maintenance operations involving containers.

## Priority
**Priority:** High

Justification: The ability for adversaries to bypass security monitoring poses a significant threat, potentially allowing them to conduct malicious activities undetected. Given the increasing adoption of containerization technologies across enterprises, this technique presents a high-risk scenario that requires prompt attention and robust detection measures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:
1. Set up a controlled container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes).
2. Deploy a benign container with logging enabled.
3. Execute commands within the container using `docker exec` or similar tools to simulate adversary behavior.
4. Introduce misconfigurations in network policies and observe traffic patterns.
5. Monitor detection alerts generated by the strategy to validate effectiveness.

## Response
Guidelines for analysts when the alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Assess the nature of the detected activity, focusing on container configurations and network connections.
2. **Isolate Affected Containers:** Quarantine any containers identified as suspicious to prevent further potential misuse.
3. **Review Configuration Changes:** Examine recent changes in container orchestration settings that may have introduced vulnerabilities.
4. **Enhance Monitoring:** Adjust detection parameters to reduce false positives while maintaining sensitivity to genuine threats.
5. **Documentation and Reporting:** Document the incident, including root cause analysis and response actions taken, for future reference and improvement of detection strategies.
