# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using container technology. This includes identifying tactics where adversaries leverage containers to obscure malicious activity, evade detection by traditional endpoint security solutions, and execute commands within isolated environments that might otherwise go unnoticed.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container activities across various platforms to identify suspicious patterns indicative of adversarial attempts. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Capturing logs from container orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and standalone containers.
- **Network Traffic:** Monitoring ingress and egress traffic associated with containerized applications for anomalies.
- **System Calls:** Analyzing system call patterns within container processes to detect unusual or unauthorized operations.

The strategy involves looking for indicators such as:

- High frequency of container creation/deletion
- Use of known C2 domains within containers
- Unusual network connections originating from containers

## Technical Context
Adversaries use containers to deploy malware or command and control (C2) servers in a way that evades traditional security monitoring. By leveraging the dynamic nature of containers, they can quickly spin up environments for malicious activities without leaving persistent traces on host systems.

**Example Adversary Techniques:**
- Deploying C2 payloads within containerized applications.
- Utilizing ephemeral DNS records to rapidly change command and control endpoints (Fast Flux).
- Executing lateral movement between hosts via shared container networks.

Adversaries might use commands such as `docker run -d --rm some-malicious-image` or Kubernetes deployments with embedded malicious payloads, making it crucial for security systems to monitor both static and dynamic environments closely.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss attacks that utilize advanced obfuscation techniques within containers, such as custom-built images that evade traditional signature-based detection.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes the presence of centralized logging and monitoring capabilities for containers. It also presumes that container runtime security tools are in place to provide necessary telemetry.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use cases involving rapid deployment or teardown of development/testing environments.
- High-volume CI/CD pipelines where container creation/destruction is frequent and expected.
- Use of legitimate services that mimic C2-like behavior for purposes such as dynamic service discovery.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

Justification: The ability to evade detection poses a significant risk, potentially allowing adversaries to maintain persistence within networks, exfiltrate data, or deploy further malicious activities without immediate detection. Given the increasing adoption of containerization in enterprise environments, this technique's potential impact is substantial.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no available step-by-step instructions for adversary emulation. However, organizations can simulate detection scenarios by:

1. Setting up a test environment with containers.
2. Deploying benign applications that mimic adversarial behavior patterns.
3. Running security monitoring tools to validate the effectiveness of detection strategies.

## Response
When an alert is triggered indicating potential adversarial activity within containers:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Temporarily isolate affected containers and hosts from the network to prevent further malicious actions or data exfiltration.
2. **Incident Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis of logs, including container runtime, orchestration platform, and network traffic logs.
3. **Root Cause Investigation:** Identify whether the alert corresponds to legitimate activity or if it is indicative of an adversarial presence.
4. **Containment Measures:** Implement necessary containment measures based on findings, such as removing malicious containers or updating security policies.
