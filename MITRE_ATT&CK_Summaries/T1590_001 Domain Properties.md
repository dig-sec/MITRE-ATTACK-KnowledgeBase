# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Domain Properties Monitoring

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to manipulate domain properties for malicious purposes, such as data exfiltration, command and control (C2) communication setup, or reconnaissance activities within an enterprise network.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1590.001 - Domain Properties
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Resource Environment)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1590/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing domain property changes to identify unauthorized or suspicious activities. Key data sources include DNS logs, Active Directory event logs, and network traffic analysis. Patterns analyzed involve unusual modifications in domain properties such as unexpected DNS record updates, changes in Service Principal Names (SPNs), or alterations in DNS zone files.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit domain property manipulations to establish covert communication channels or redirect legitimate traffic for malicious purposes. Common techniques include adding new subdomains for C2 infrastructure, modifying DNS records to hijack legitimate sites, and changing SPN attributes to impersonate services. In a real-world scenario, adversaries might use commands like `dnscmd` to modify DNS zones or PowerShell scripts to alter Active Directory properties.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Command:** Using `dnscmd /RecordAdd <zone> <name> A <IP>` to add a malicious A record.
- **Test Scenario:** Simulate the creation of unauthorized subdomains within a controlled environment, monitoring for detection alerts.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection might miss highly stealthy modifications made during regular maintenance windows.
  - Limited visibility into encrypted DNS traffic without additional decryption mechanisms.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes baseline knowledge of normal domain property configurations for effective anomaly detection.
  - Relies on comprehensive logging and monitoring infrastructure.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Authorized IT staff performing legitimate updates to DNS records or Active Directory settings.
- Automated scripts running routine maintenance tasks without malicious intent.
- Legitimate use of dynamic DNS services for network management.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Domain property manipulations can facilitate significant breaches, including data exfiltration and establishment of C2 infrastructure. The high potential impact on organizational security justifies prioritizing detection efforts for this technique.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Setup Environment:** Configure a test domain with logging enabled for DNS changes and Active Directory modifications.
2. **Simulate Adversarial Activity:**
   - Use `dnscmd` to add an unauthorized A record in the DNS zone.
   - Modify SPN attributes using PowerShell scripts.
3. **Monitor Alerts:** Verify detection systems trigger alerts upon these simulated activities.

## Response
When an alert for domain property manipulation fires, analysts should:
- Immediately verify the legitimacy of the changes by consulting with IT operations and change management records.
- Investigate network traffic patterns associated with the modified domain properties to identify potential exfiltration or C2 activity.
- Review user accounts involved in the changes for signs of compromise.
- Implement additional security controls if malicious intent is confirmed, such as blocking unauthorized subdomains.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently not available. However, organizations should consult their internal documentation on domain management practices and collaborate with cybersecurity experts to enhance detection capabilities.
