# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. The focus is on identifying activities where adversaries use containers to obscure command-and-control (C2) traffic, evade detection mechanisms, or perform unauthorized actions within a network.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages network traffic analysis combined with container orchestration logs to identify anomalous behavior that suggests the misuse of containers for adversarial purposes. The primary data sources include:

- **Network Traffic:** Monitoring for unusual outbound connections, unexpected protocol usage (e.g., non-standard ports or encrypted traffic), and irregular communication patterns.
  
- **Container Logs:** Analysis of orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and Docker logs to detect unexpected image pulls, container spawning without prior authorization, and modifications in runtime environments.

Key patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual spikes in network traffic originating from containers
- Containers accessing network resources typically reserved for administrative or sensitive operations
- Non-standard configurations or updates applied to containers

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit the flexibility and abstraction provided by container technologies to hide their activities. They often employ tactics such as:

- **Setting up C2 servers within containers:** This allows adversaries to use containerized environments as intermediaries for command-and-control traffic, making it difficult to distinguish from legitimate application-level traffic.

- **Using containers to obfuscate malicious payloads:** By embedding harmful code within benign-looking container images or leveraging ephemeral containers, attackers can evade traditional detection mechanisms.

Adversary emulation details may involve:
- Command: `docker run -d --name hidden_c2_server malicious_image`
- Scenario: Launching a C2 server within a Docker container without any associated legitimate application behavior

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption of Normal Operations:** The strategy assumes that baseline network and container activity patterns are well-understood, which may not always be the case in dynamic environments.
  
- **Blind Spots in Encrypted Traffic:** Detection is less effective when C2 traffic is heavily encrypted or tunneled through legitimate services.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts might include:
- Legitimate use of containers for rapid development and deployment cycles, resulting in unusual network patterns
- Authorized but infrequent administrative tasks carried out via containerized tools
- Scheduled automated processes that mimic adversary behavior

## Priority
**High:** Given the increasing adoption of container technologies in modern IT environments, the ability to bypass security monitoring presents a significant risk. This prioritization is justified by the potential for adversaries to gain undetected access and move laterally within networks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
- None available

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate affected containers and review their configurations and network activities.
2. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough analysis of network traffic logs, container orchestration records, and system behavior to identify the root cause.
3. **Remediation:** Remove malicious containers and update security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.
