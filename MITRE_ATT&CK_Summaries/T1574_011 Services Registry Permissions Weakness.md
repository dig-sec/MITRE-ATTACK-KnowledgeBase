# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Services Registry Permissions Weakness (T1574.011)

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using services registry permissions weaknesses on Windows systems. This involves detecting unauthorized changes and modifications in service configurations that could facilitate persistence, privilege escalation, or evasion techniques.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** [T1574.011 - Services Registry Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:**
  - Persistence
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources, including system logs (Event Logs), registry monitoring tools, and endpoint detection solutions. Patterns analyzed include unauthorized changes to service registry keys, modifications of service ImagePath values, and unexpected elevation of privileges through altered service configurations.

### Data Sources Utilized:
- **Windows Event Logs:** Monitor for Service Control Manager events.
- **Registry Monitoring Tools:** Detect modifications in specific registry paths related to services.
- **Endpoint Detection Solutions:** Identify suspicious behaviors and unauthorized access attempts on Windows systems.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in service registry permissions by altering registry keys that control how Windows services operate. Commonly targeted entries include `ImagePath` or `ServiceDLL`. Attackers might escalate privileges by modifying these values to load malicious binaries upon service startup.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Use of `reg.exe` for modifying the ImagePath of a service:
    ```shell
    reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<ServiceName>" /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "C:\malicious\malware.exe" /f
    ```
  - Commands to change permissions on registry keys to allow write access.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss sophisticated adversaries who use encrypted or obfuscated payloads.
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes baseline understanding of normal service configurations and behavior.
  - Relies on accurate logging and monitoring configurations being in place prior to any attack attempt.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Authorized system administrators making legitimate updates or changes to service configurations for maintenance purposes.
- Software installations or updates that modify registry settings related to services as part of their installation process.

## Priority
**Priority Level: High**

### Justification:
The technique allows adversaries significant control over the system, potentially leading to persistent access and privilege escalation. Given its potential impact on system integrity and confidentiality, monitoring this vector is critical for maintaining robust security posture.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Prepare Test Environment:**
   - Set up a controlled Windows machine with necessary permissions to modify registry keys.
   
2. **Service Registry Permissions Weakness:**
   - Modify service registry key permissions:
     ```shell
     reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<ServiceName>" /ve /t REG_SZ /d "<NewValue>" /f
     ```
   - Ensure the account used for testing has administrative privileges.

3. **Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe:**
   - Execute:
     ```shell
     reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<ServiceName>" /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "C:\test\new_executable.exe" /f
     ```

4. **Observe and Record:** 
   - Monitor the system logs and registry changes to confirm detection.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network.
- Review recent changes in service configurations and associated permissions.
- Investigate the source of unauthorized modifications using log analysis and endpoint detection data.
- Revert any malicious changes made to registry keys and ensure services are restored to their original configuration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the attack vector and entry point.

## Additional Resources
No additional references available. However, further study into Windows service behaviors and regular updates on MITRE ATT&CK framework for evolving adversary tactics is recommended for maintaining effective detection strategies.
