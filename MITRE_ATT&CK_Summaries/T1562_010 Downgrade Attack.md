# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Downgrade Attack Detection

## Goal
The primary objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using downgrade attacks. Specifically, it aims to identify efforts by adversaries to revert software versions or configurations to exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated versions.

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of system logs, configuration management databases (CMDB), and version control systems to identify downgrade attempts. By correlating data from these sources, the strategy can detect discrepancies in software versions or configurations that suggest an intentional downgrade. Patterns analyzed include unexpected changes in acceptance levels for software packages and unexplained rollbacks in version numbers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often execute downgrade attacks by modifying system settings to allow older software versions or bypass security updates. For example:
- In virtualized environments, adversaries might change the Virtual Infrastructure Building (VIB) acceptance level on ESXi hosts from CommerciallySupported to CommunitySupported.
- On Windows systems, attackers may manipulate registry settings to force applications into using older DLLs.

### Adversary Emulation Details
#### Sample Commands:
- **ESXi - PowerCLI:**  
  ```powershell
  Get-VMHost | ForEach-Object {
      Set-VMHostAdvancedConfiguration -VMHost $_ -ConfigVersion "CommunitySupported"
  }
  ```
- **ESXi - ESXCLI:**  
  ```bash
  esxcli software vib install --accept-community-supported=true
  ```

#### Test Scenarios:
- Simulate a PowerShell downgrade by configuring an environment to use version 2 instead of the latest available.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss downgrades executed through undocumented or less common configuration files.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that all systems are regularly scanned for compliance with accepted software versions, and baseline configurations are well-documented.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Authorized IT maintenance tasks involving version rollbacks for compatibility testing.
- Automated scripts running as part of scheduled system updates or patches that inadvertently revert to older versions due to misconfigurations.

## Priority
**High:** Downgrade attacks can significantly compromise security postures by reintroducing known vulnerabilities. The potential impact on systems is severe, making this a high-priority detection strategy.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:
1. **ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via PowerCLI:**
   ```powershell
   Get-VMHost | ForEach-Object {
       Set-VMHostAdvancedConfiguration -VMHost $_ -ConfigVersion "CommunitySupported"
   }
   ```
2. **ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI:**
   ```bash
   esxcli software vib install --accept-community-supported=true
   ```
3. **PowerShell Version 2 Downgrade:**  
   Configure the environment to force PowerShell to load version 2 by setting registry keys or using group policy.

## Response
When an alert for a downgrade attack is triggered:
1. Immediately isolate affected systems from the network.
2. Verify recent changes in software configurations and acceptance levels.
3. Revert any unauthorized downgrades and ensure all components are updated to their latest, secure versions.
4. Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if other systems may be similarly compromised.
