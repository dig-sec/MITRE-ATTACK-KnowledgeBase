# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Verclsid Technique

## Goal
The objective of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using the `Verclsid` utility on Windows platforms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1218.012 - Verclsid  
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion  
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This strategy leverages process monitoring to detect the execution of `verclsid.exe`, a legitimate Microsoft utility used by attackers to enumerate COM objects and their CLSIDs. The detection is achieved by analyzing Windows event logs, specifically focusing on Process Creation events (Event ID 4688) for anomalies.

### Data Sources:
- **Windows Event Logs:** Primarily using the Security log.
- **Sysmon Logs:** Enhanced process creation details if Sysmon is deployed.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Execution of `verclsid.exe` from uncommon command-line arguments or execution paths, particularly by non-administrative users or processes originating from unusual locations (e.g., network shares).

## Technical Context
Adversaries employ the `Verclsid` technique to evade detection by identifying COM objects that could potentially be used in their attack payloads. The utility lists CLSIDs for all registered COM components, which can help attackers find vulnerable targets within a system.

### Adversary Execution:
- **Command:** 
  ```
  verclsid.exe /s > C:\output.txt
  ```

- **Common Scenarios:**
  - Execution from non-standard directories or through command injection.
  - Usage by non-administrative accounts in environments where such behavior is atypical.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Legitimate use cases of `verclsid.exe` for system administration purposes may go undetected if they mimic adversarial patterns.
  - Encrypted or obfuscated command-line arguments are not detectable without deeper inspection tools.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The environment is configured to log all relevant events (4688) with Sysmon in use, which enhances detection capabilities.
  - Baseline behavior for `verclsid.exe` usage has been established under normal operation conditions.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- System administrators or developers using `verclsid.exe` as part of routine diagnostics or software development activities.
- Automated scripts executing `verclsid.exe` in environments where such operations are considered benign.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the use of `verclsid.exe` is not inherently malicious, its exploitation by adversaries to identify vulnerable COM objects poses a significant risk. The detection capability hinges on distinguishing between legitimate administrative activities and adversarial actions.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no step-by-step instructions available for emulating this technique in a test environment due to the reliance on specific adversary behaviors that might not be replicable safely without risking system integrity.

## Response
Upon receiving an alert regarding suspicious `verclsid.exe` execution:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the context of the process creation, including user account and originating IP address.
   - Review other related events around the time of detection for signs of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Follow-Up:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of all registered COM components on affected systems to identify any vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
   - Update security policies and monitoring rules to account for legitimate `verclsid.exe` usage patterns observed within your environment.

## Additional Resources
- Further insights into Windows event log analysis can be found in Microsoft's documentation.
- For advanced detection techniques, consider integrating threat intelligence feeds specific to known adversarial tactics using COM objects. 

This strategy serves as a guide for organizations aiming to enhance their defensive posture against sophisticated adversaries utilizing the `Verclsid` technique.
