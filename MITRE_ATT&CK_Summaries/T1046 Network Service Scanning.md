# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Network Service Scanning Attempts

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by conducting network service scanning across various environments. The primary objective is to detect unauthorized network reconnaissance activities that could precede more significant attacks.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1046 - Network Service Scanning
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** Windows, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Containers
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages a combination of network traffic monitoring and endpoint telemetry to identify patterns indicative of network service scanning. Key data sources include:

- **Network Traffic Logs:** Analyze for unusual spikes in connection requests across multiple ports, especially those commonly associated with reconnaissance.
- **Endpoint System Logs:** Monitor for tools or scripts that automate port scans or network discovery tasks.
- **Container Orchestrator Logs:** Evaluate logs from Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for abnormal service discovery attempts.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Sudden increase in outbound connections to a wide range of ports across different IP addresses.
- Usage of known reconnaissance tools (e.g., Nmap, Masscan).
- Unusual patterns of failed connection attempts indicative of scanning activities.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use network service scanning as an initial step to gather information about potential targets within a network. This can involve:

- **Port Scanning:** Identifying open ports and services running on hosts.
- **Service Enumeration:** Determining the version and configuration of services exposed by open ports.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Probing for known vulnerabilities associated with specific services.

Common tools include Nmap, Masscan, and custom scripts. Attackers may also use containerized environments to obscure their activities from traditional network monitoring solutions.

### Adversary Emulation Details

Sample commands for emulation:

- **Nmap Port Scan:**
  ```bash
  nmap -p- <target-ip>
  ```

- **Masscan:**
  ```bash
  masscan --rate=1000 <subnet>
  ```

- **Python Port Scanner:**
  ```python
  import socket

  def scan_ports(ip, port_range):
      open_ports = []
      for port in range(port_range[0], port_range[1]):
          sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
          sock.settimeout(1)
          result = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))
          if result == 0:
              open_ports.append(port)
          sock.close()
      return open_ports

  print(scan_ports('192.168.1.1', (20, 85)))
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Encrypted traffic may obscure scanning activities.
  - Use of legitimate network management tools that perform similar scans.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Network baselines are well-defined to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior.
  - Logs from all relevant sources are available and properly correlated.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities include:

- Legitimate security assessments or penetration testing.
- Automated network management tasks (e.g., configuration checks).
- Misconfigured applications attempting to connect to multiple services.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

Justification: Network service scanning is often the precursor to more targeted attacks, making early detection critical for preventing potential breaches and data exfiltration.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Steps to Emulate Network Service Scanning:

1. **Port Scan with Nmap:**
   - Execute `nmap -p- <target-ip>` on a controlled environment.

2. **Masscan Execution:**
   - Run `masscan --rate=1000 <subnet>` within a test network segment.

3. **NMap for Windows:**
   - Use `nmap -p- <target-ip>` on a Windows machine to simulate scanning from that platform.

4. **Python Port Scanner:**
   - Implement the provided Python script in a safe environment.

5. **WinPwn Tools:**
   - Test spoolvulnscan, MS17-10, bluekeep, and fruit exploits on controlled Windows systems.

6. **Container Network Service Discovery:**
   - Use `kubectl exec` to run network discovery tools within containers.

7. **PowerShell Port Scan /24 Subnet:**
   - Execute PowerShell scripts to scan a subnet for open ports.

8. **Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell:**
   - Utilize PowerShell commands to probe RDS configurations.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Verify the Source:** Confirm if the activity originates from a legitimate source.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems or networks to prevent further scanning.
3. **Investigation:** Analyze logs and traffic patterns for indicators of compromise (IoCs).
4. **Remediation:** Apply necessary patches or configuration changes to close vulnerabilities.
5. **Alert Stakeholders:** Inform relevant teams about the potential threat.
