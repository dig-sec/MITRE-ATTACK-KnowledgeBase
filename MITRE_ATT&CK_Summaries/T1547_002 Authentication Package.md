# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging authentication packages on Windows platforms. Specifically, it aims to identify unauthorized use of authentication packages that could facilitate persistence and privilege escalation.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1547.002 - Authentication Package
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/002)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages security event logs and process monitoring to identify suspicious modifications or use of authentication packages. Key data sources include:
- Security Event Logs (e.g., logon events, policy change events)
- Process Activity Monitoring

Patterns analyzed involve unexpected changes in authentication package configurations, unauthorized service creation associated with known malicious authentication packages, and anomalous logon attempts using these packages.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by exploiting misconfigured or vulnerable authentication packages to maintain persistence on a system. This often involves:
- Installing malicious authentication packages that are loaded at boot.
- Using tools such as `schtasks` or registry modifications to ensure the package is executed with elevated privileges.

**Example Commands:**
```shell
# Example of creating a scheduled task for persistence
schtasks /create /tn "EvilTask" /tr "C:\Malware\malicious.exe" /sc onstart

# Example of modifying registry to load an authentication package at startup
reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MyService /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "%SystemRoot%\System32\evil.dll"
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Detection may miss if adversaries use obfuscated scripts or native code to modify authentication packages.
  - The strategy assumes that all significant modifications to authentication packages are logged accurately.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Security logs are comprehensive and not tampered with by adversaries.
  - Baseline behavior for authentication package usage is well understood and documented.

## False Positives
Potential false positives could include:
- Legitimate IT operations involving changes to authentication configurations for maintenance or updates.
- Use of third-party security solutions that modify authentication settings as part of their operation.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The technique involves bypassing fundamental security controls and can lead to persistent access with elevated privileges, posing significant risks to the organization's security posture.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Set Up Test Environment:**
   - Prepare a Windows-based virtual machine for testing.
   - Ensure logging is enabled for all relevant event logs.

2. **Modify Authentication Package:**
   - Use the command line or registry editor to simulate changes:
     ```shell
     reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MyService /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "%SystemRoot%\System32\evil.dll"
     ```

3. **Schedule Persistence Task:**
   - Use `schtasks` to create a task that mimics malicious persistence:
     ```shell
     schtasks /create /tn "EvilTask" /tr "C:\Malware\malicious.exe" /sc onstart
     ```

4. **Monitor Logs and Alerts:**
   - Check security event logs for unauthorized changes.
   - Verify alerts are triggered by the modifications.

5. **Review Detection Output:**
   - Confirm that the detection strategy identifies the simulated malicious activity accurately.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   
2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze security logs to determine the scope and impact of the compromise.
   - Identify all processes or tasks related to the malicious authentication package.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove unauthorized authentication packages and associated scheduled tasks.
   - Restore configurations to a known good state using backups if necessary.

4. **Post-Incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of security controls and logging practices.
   - Update detection rules as needed to address any gaps identified during the incident.
