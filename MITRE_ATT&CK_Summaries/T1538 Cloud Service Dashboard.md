# Detection Strategy: Adversarial Bypass of Security Monitoring via Containerization

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection strategy is to identify attempts by adversaries to bypass security monitoring systems using container technologies within cloud environments.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1538 - Cloud Service Dashboard
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** Azure AD, Office 365, IaaS, Google Workspace

## Strategy Abstract

This strategy leverages telemetry and logs from various cloud service platforms to detect unusual activities related to container deployment that may indicate an attempt to bypass security monitoring. The data sources utilized include:

- **Azure Monitor:** For insights into resource usage, performance metrics, and network traffic.
- **Office 365 Security & Compliance Center:** To track anomalies in email communications linked with container orchestration.
- **Google Cloud's Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver):** To monitor logs from Google Workspace for suspicious activities.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unexpected spikes in CPU or memory usage by containers not tied to known application workloads.
- Deployment of containers without corresponding security group changes or firewall rules updates.
- Abnormal network traffic patterns originating from containerized environments, especially to external endpoints.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use containers to deploy malicious code because they can easily be spun up and torn down, making detection and tracking difficult. They may also leverage legitimate services like Kubernetes for orchestration while masking their activities within normal traffic.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries might execute these techniques using the following methods:

- Deploying unauthorized Docker or Kubernetes clusters.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in container images to gain elevated privileges.
- Using containers as a pivot point to launch lateral movement across cloud resources.

Adversary emulation may involve deploying test containers with known patterns of behavior that mimic malicious activities, such as connecting to unusual external IPs or accessing sensitive data stores without proper permissions.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

Known limitations include:

- **Dynamic Nature:** Containers can be ephemeral, making it difficult to correlate logs across short-lived instances.
- **Resource Limitation:** Not all cloud platforms provide detailed container-level monitoring by default.
- **Assumption of Normalcy:** The strategy assumes baseline knowledge of normal application behavior within containers.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate deployment of new containerized applications during business-as-usual operations.
- High-resource utilization due to legitimate spikes in user demand or testing phases.
- Misconfigured security tools generating unnecessary logs and metrics.

## Priority

The priority level for this detection strategy is **High**. Given the increasing adoption of containers in enterprise environments, adversaries are more likely to exploit these technologies as a means to avoid detection, making it imperative to have robust monitoring mechanisms in place.

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. **Immediate Assessment:** Determine if the alert corresponds with any scheduled activities or known benign events.
2. **Investigate Logs:** Examine detailed logs from Azure Monitor, Office 365 Security Center, and Google Cloud for anomalous patterns.
3. **Quarantine Resources:** Temporarily isolate affected containers to prevent potential spread of malicious activity.
4. **Engage Incident Response Team:** Initiate a full investigation involving the cybersecurity incident response team if necessary.
