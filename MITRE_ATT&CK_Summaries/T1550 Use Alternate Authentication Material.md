# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging containers. Attackers often use container technologies to create isolated environments that can evade detection while executing malicious activities.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1550 - Use Alternate Authentication Material
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Windows, Office 365, SaaS, Google Workspace, IaaS

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy utilizes a combination of telemetry from various data sources such as container orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes), system logs, network traffic, and user activity monitoring tools. Patterns analyzed include unusual or unauthorized container activities, unexpected changes in access permissions, and anomalous network connections originating from containers.

Key elements involve:
- Monitoring for the creation of new containers without proper authorization.
- Detecting changes in container configurations that could indicate evasion attempts.
- Analyzing network traffic patterns to identify suspicious communication between containers and external endpoints.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by deploying containers with elevated privileges or by manipulating existing containers to perform unauthorized actions. These containers can be used for command-and-control (C2) operations, data exfiltration, or as a pivot point within the network.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:** Use of Kubernetes commands such as `kubectl create` with altered configurations.
- **Test Scenarios:** Deploying unauthorized container images that attempt to establish outbound connections to known malicious IPs.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Limited visibility into encrypted traffic within containers could hide malicious activities.
  - Detection might not capture advanced techniques where adversaries use legitimate administrative tools to bypass controls.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Security teams have access to comprehensive logging from container orchestration platforms.
  - The baseline of normal activity is well-established, allowing for the detection of anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate deployments or updates of containers that are part of regular maintenance.
- Authorized use of automation tools within containers that may mimic adversarial behavior patterns.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
Justification: The ability to bypass security controls using containers presents a significant risk as it can allow adversaries to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, and move laterally across environments undetected.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific emulation steps are provided. However, organizations should:
- Set up test environments that mirror production configurations.
- Simulate unauthorized container deployments and monitor for detection efficacy.
- Validate the alerting system's response to both malicious and benign activities.

## Response
When an alert related to this strategy is triggered, analysts should:
1. **Investigate:** Examine logs from container orchestrators and network traffic to confirm suspicious activity.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further unauthorized actions.
3. **Analysis:** Determine the scope of the breach and identify any compromised data or systems.
4. **Remediation:** Remove malicious containers, revoke unnecessary privileges, and update security policies.
5. **Reporting:** Document findings and share insights with relevant stakeholders to improve future detection capabilities.
