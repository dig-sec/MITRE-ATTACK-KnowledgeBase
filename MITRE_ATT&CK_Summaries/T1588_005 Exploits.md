# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using containers. This often involves adversaries leveraging container technology to obfuscate their activities and evade traditional security controls.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1588.005 - Exploits
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Reference Architecture)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/005)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing activities within containerized environments to identify potential adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Network traffic associated with containers
- Host system activity related to container operations

Patterns of interest include unusual or unauthorized container deployments, unexpected changes in network configurations, and anomalous resource usage that could indicate exploitation attempts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to execute malicious payloads while evading detection by leveraging the inherent isolation properties of container technology. Common methods include:

- Deploying malware within a container that mimics legitimate traffic patterns.
- Using containers to facilitate lateral movement across networks.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in container management tools.

**Emulation Details:**
To emulate this technique, adversaries might use commands such as:
```bash
docker run -d --name malicious_container -v /sensitive_data:/data sensitive_image
```
This command creates a container named `malicious_container` that mounts a host directory to access or exfiltrate data.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** The strategy may not detect sophisticated evasion techniques where adversaries use advanced obfuscation methods within containers.
- **Assumptions:** It assumes that all container activity is logged and accessible for analysis, which might not always be the case in environments with misconfigured logging.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate development or testing operations involving frequent creation and destruction of containers.
- Routine administrative tasks that involve modifying network configurations for containers.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

Justification: The use of containers to bypass security monitoring can lead to significant breaches, as adversaries may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems. Early detection is crucial to mitigate potential damage.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating suspicious container activity:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analyze the logs and network traffic associated with the flagged container.
2. **Containment:** Isolate the suspected container to prevent further malicious activity.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the scope of the breach and identify any compromised data or systems.
4. **Remediation:** Apply necessary patches or updates to address vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.
5. **Reporting:** Document findings and update security protocols to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available for this specific detection strategy. However, staying informed about the latest container security practices and threat intelligence is recommended.
