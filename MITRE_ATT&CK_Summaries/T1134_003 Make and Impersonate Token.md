# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Tokens on Windows

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by making and impersonating access tokens on Windows platforms, a tactic that can be used for defense evasion or privilege escalation.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1134.003 - Make and Impersonate Token
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing specific data sources within the Windows operating system to identify patterns associated with token manipulation. Key data sources include:

- Security event logs (Event ID: 4672, 4673, 4688)
- Process creation and access events

Pattern analysis involves detecting anomalies in process impersonation and unexpected changes in security contexts that could indicate attempts to create or misuse tokens for evading detection.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by using Windows APIs such as `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser`, `DuplicateTokenEx`, and `CreateProcessAsUser`. These functions allow malicious actors to create new tokens with the privileges of legitimate users, thus bypassing security measures. 

**Example Commands:**
- Use of `procdump.exe` or similar tools to capture process dumps while impersonating a user.
- Execution of scripts that use native Windows scripting capabilities (PowerShell/WSH) to manipulate token access.

### Adversary Emulation
To emulate this technique in a controlled environment, administrators can:
1. Set up a virtual machine running Windows.
2. Use `procdump.exe` with the `-h` flag followed by a legitimate userâ€™s process identifier to impersonate and dump the process information.
3. Monitor for Event IDs (4672/4673) that indicate token creation or duplication activities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** The strategy assumes that all relevant security events are properly configured and logged.
- **Limitation:** It may not detect sophisticated evasion techniques where adversaries use zero-day exploits to manipulate tokens outside of standard monitoring scopes.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate administrative activities involving token duplication for maintenance or troubleshooting purposes.
- Software installations that require elevated privileges temporarily during setup processes.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

The technique can be highly effective in bypassing security controls, leading to unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network. The potential impact on data confidentiality and system integrity justifies a high priority for detection.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify the context of token creation or impersonation events.
2. **User Correlation:** Cross-check with user activity logs to ensure legitimacy.
3. **Containment Measures:** Temporarily disable accounts involved if suspicious, and isolate affected systems.
4. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the scope and origin of the activity.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context is available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework documentation. Organizations are encouraged to develop internal knowledge bases with specific examples and case studies from their environment for enhanced detection capabilities.
