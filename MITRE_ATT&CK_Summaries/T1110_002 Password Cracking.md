# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of Containers to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. Attackers may use containers to obfuscate malicious activities, allowing them to execute code while evading traditional detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous container activities that suggest adversarial intent. Key data sources include container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes), system and application logs, network traffic analysis, and endpoint detection solutions. Patterns analyzed involve unusual container image pulls, atypical resource usage spikes within containers, and abnormal inter-container communication.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit the inherent flexibility of container environments to deploy and conceal malicious payloads. By embedding malicious binaries or scripts into container images, attackers can execute these payloads on compromised systems without triggering traditional security controls.

### Real-World Execution
Attackers might:
- Pull suspicious or unauthorized containers from public registries.
- Execute processes within containers that mimic legitimate services but perform malicious activities.
- Use container escape techniques to gain host access and further evade detection.

**Sample Commands for Adversary Emulation:**
```bash
# Pull a potentially malicious container image
docker pull malicious_image

# Run the container with escalated privileges
sudo docker run --rm -v /:/mnt:rwm malicious_image
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** The strategy may not detect sophisticated obfuscation techniques where adversaries employ legitimate images with embedded payloads. Additionally, encrypted or compressed payloads within containers might evade pattern-based detection.
  
- **Assumptions:** It assumes that container management platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) are configured to log detailed activity data and that security teams have access to this information for analysis.

## False Positives
Potential false positives could include:
- Legitimate use of large-scale container deployments, such as during software updates or new service rollouts.
- Authorized pulling of images from public registries by developers following best practices but appearing anomalous due to lack of context in logs.
  
To mitigate false positives, implement context-aware rules and integrate threat intelligence feeds to distinguish between benign and malicious activities.

## Priority
**High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly adopted across enterprises for their scalability and flexibility. The ability for adversaries to exploit these environments significantly raises the risk profile. Given that containers can operate with elevated privileges, detecting adversarial use is crucial for maintaining organizational security integrity.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Password Cracking with Hashcat

To validate detection effectiveness against password cracking attempts using containers:

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure Docker and Hashcat are installed on a test machine.
   - Create a vulnerable dataset containing hashed passwords for testing purposes.

2. **Pull and Run Hashcat Container:**
   ```bash
   # Pull the official Hashcat container image
   docker pull ghcr.io/hashcat/hashcat

   # Mount the local directory with hashed data to the container
   sudo docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/hashes:/mnt/ hashes hashcat64.bin --force --show /mnt/somehashedpasswords.txt
   ```

3. **Monitor Container Activity:**
   - Capture logs related to image pulls and process executions.
   - Observe resource usage patterns for anomalies indicative of password cracking efforts.

4. **Analyze Results:**
   - Validate that detection mechanisms trigger alerts when Hashcat attempts are detected within containers.
   - Ensure no false negatives occur by adjusting thresholds and rules based on the emulation results.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify Context:** Confirm whether the container activity correlates with known legitimate operations or scheduled tasks.
   
2. **Investigate Anomalies:** Examine logs for unusual patterns such as unauthorized image pulls or unexpected resource spikes.
   
3. **Contain and Mitigate:** If malicious intent is confirmed, isolate affected containers and revoke any compromised credentials.

4. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the scope of compromise and prevent recurrence.

5. **Documentation and Reporting:** Record findings and actions taken for future reference and compliance purposes.
