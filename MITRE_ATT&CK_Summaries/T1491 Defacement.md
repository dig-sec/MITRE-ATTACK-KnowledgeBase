## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container orchestration platforms and host systems to identify unusual activities indicative of adversarial attempts to bypass security controls. Data sources include logs from container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm), system logs, network traffic data, and endpoint protection logs. Patterns analyzed include unexpected changes in container configurations, unauthorized deployments, anomalous network traffic originating from containers, and discrepancies between deployed and expected configurations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to encapsulate malicious payloads that evade traditional security monitoring tools. This can be achieved by leveraging the ephemeral nature of containers or exploiting misconfigurations in container management systems. Common tactics include deploying malware within a container to avoid detection by host-based security solutions, using containers for lateral movement, or exfiltrating data through containerized applications.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Deploy a malicious container image:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -d --name malicious_container malicious_image
    ```
  - Modify network settings to facilitate unauthorized outbound connections:
    ```bash
    iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
    ```

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a container with an unexpected image and monitor for anomalies.
  - Configure a container to establish unusual outbound connections.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover all evasion techniques, especially those exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in container platforms.
  - Highly skilled adversaries might use advanced obfuscation techniques that evade pattern-based detection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes comprehensive logging is enabled on both containers and hosts.
  - Relies on baseline behavior established for normal container operations.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate deployments of new or updated container images by authorized users.
- Network traffic spikes during legitimate maintenance windows or software updates.
- Temporary configuration changes made for testing purposes in development environments.

## Priority
**High:** The potential impact of undetected adversarial activity using containers is significant, as it can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and disruption of services. Given the increasing reliance on containerized applications, securing these environments is critical.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are currently unavailable. However, organizations should consider setting up controlled test scenarios where benign containers are manipulated to mimic adversarial behaviors for validation purposes.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential adversarial activity within containers fires:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Cross-reference logs and network data to confirm the legitimacy of the alert.
2. **Contain the Threat:**
   - Isolate affected containers from the network.
   - Halt any suspicious processes running within those containers.
3. **Investigate:**
   - Analyze container images for known vulnerabilities or malicious code.
   - Review recent changes in configuration and deployment practices.
4. **Remediate:**
   - Patch identified vulnerabilities.
   - Revoke unauthorized access and update security policies as needed.
5. **Document Findings:** Record the incident details, actions taken, and lessons learned to improve future detection and response strategies.
