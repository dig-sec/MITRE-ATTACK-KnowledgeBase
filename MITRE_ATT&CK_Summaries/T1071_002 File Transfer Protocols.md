# Detection of Adversarial Container Usage to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The primary aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to use containers as a means to bypass security monitoring systems. This involves identifying scenarios where adversaries might deploy containers for malicious activities, such as command and control (C2) operations, data exfiltration, or running unauthorized processes, all while evading detection.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1071.002 - File Transfer Protocols
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/002)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying anomalous container activities that could indicate adversarial use. Key data sources include container orchestrator logs (e.g., Kubernetes), host-level monitoring, network traffic patterns, and file system activity within containers. Patterns analyzed involve unusual container configurations, unexpected network communications originating from containers, and deviations in resource usage or process execution.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containers to execute malicious activities with reduced detection risk due to their lightweight nature and common use for legitimate purposes. Real-world adversaries might:
- Use popular orchestration tools like Kubernetes to deploy malicious containers.
- Employ reverse shells or custom C2 protocols that are hard to distinguish from benign container traffic.
- Utilize volume mounts or network namespaces to interact with the host system stealthily.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
Example commands could include setting up a Docker container to act as a command and control endpoint:
```bash
docker run -d --name malicious-container -p 1234:80 my-malicious-image
```
This command starts a new container with exposed ports that might be used for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Limited visibility into encrypted network traffic.
  - Difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate automated processes and adversarial activities within containers.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Container activity logs are comprehensive and properly configured for logging all relevant events.
  - The security monitoring system is capable of integrating with container orchestrators.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development or testing environments where unusual configurations might be standard.
- Network traffic associated with benign microservices that exhibit similar patterns to C2 traffic.
- Automated backup processes or other maintenance tasks within containers that may temporarily spike resource usage.

## Priority
**High:** Containers provide a modern, flexible environment for adversaries to conduct operations. The ability of attackers to hide malicious activities in containerized environments poses a significant threat due to the increasing reliance on these technologies across enterprises.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no publicly available step-by-step instructions provided for emulating this technique securely within a test environment. Organizations should develop their own controlled scenarios that reflect their specific infrastructure and security monitoring setups to validate detection strategies effectively.

## Response
When an alert for suspicious container activity is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Assess the scope of the container's activities, including network connections, processes running inside, and any mounted volumes or host interactions.
2. **Quarantine:** Isolate the affected containers to prevent potential spread of malicious activity.
3. **Log Analysis:** Review detailed logs from both the orchestrator and the host system for additional context on the suspicious behavior.
4. **Incident Response Coordination:** Engage incident response teams to determine if further action, such as forensic analysis or network segmentation, is required.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no specific external resources provided beyond general container security best practices and relevant MITRE ATT&CK documentation. Organizations should continue to refer to up-to-date sources on container security and threat intelligence for evolving threats related to this technique.
