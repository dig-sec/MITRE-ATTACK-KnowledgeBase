# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. These adversaries may leverage container technology to hide their activities from traditional security tools and evade detection.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing container activities to identify suspicious behavior indicative of an attempt to bypass security controls. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Monitor for unusual or unauthorized container deployment patterns.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identify anomalous DNS requests associated with container activity.
- **Configuration Management Systems:** Track changes in container configurations that may facilitate evasion.

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Unusual network traffic originating from containers to known malicious domains.
- Rapid creation and destruction of containers, which might indicate efforts to evade detection.
- Container configuration changes that reduce logging or visibility.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit the ephemeral nature of containers and their ability to isolate processes. By running malicious activities within containers, they attempt to bypass traditional security monitoring. Techniques include:

- **Command Execution:** Adversaries may use commands such as `docker run -d --name <container_name> <image>` to deploy a container stealthily.
- **Test Scenario:** Deploy a container that makes DNS requests to known malicious IPs and observe if the activity goes unnoticed by traditional security tools.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:
- Detection may be hindered by highly sophisticated adversaries who are aware of monitoring strategies.
- Assumption that all network traffic from containers can be effectively monitored, which might not hold in environments with high traffic volumes or limited visibility.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts:
- Legitimate use of containerized applications for development and testing purposes.
- Automated deployment processes that frequently create and destroy containers as part of CI/CD pipelines.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring poses a significant threat, allowing adversaries to conduct malicious activities undetected. Containers are increasingly used in enterprise environments, making this detection strategy critical for maintaining robust security posture.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available for adversary emulation of this technique within a test environment. Developing such scenarios requires careful planning and collaboration with cybersecurity professionals to ensure safety and accuracy.

## Response
When the alert fires:
1. **Immediate Analysis:** Quickly analyze logs and network traffic associated with the alert.
2. **Containment:** Isolate the suspicious container and its network activities.
3. **Investigation:** Determine the intent behind the activity by examining configuration changes, command history, and communication patterns.
4. **Remediation:** If malicious intent is confirmed, remove the affected containers, restore configurations to secure states, and patch vulnerabilities.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional references or context available for this specific detection strategy. Continuous research and collaboration with security communities can provide further insights into evolving container-based evasion techniques.
