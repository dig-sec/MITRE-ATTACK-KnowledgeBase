# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal

This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using VNC protocols on Windows systems.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1021.005 - Virtual Network Computing (VNC)
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Lateral Movement
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages network traffic analysis to identify VNC sessions. Data sources include network logs and endpoint monitoring tools. Patterns analyzed involve unusual outbound connections on VNC ports (5900-5999) and unexpected application behaviors indicative of VNC usage.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use VNC for lateral movement by establishing remote desktop connections, allowing them to control systems without direct access. This technique is typically executed using commands such as:

```bash
vncviewer -connect <target_ip>:5900
```

In real-world scenarios, attackers may deploy VNC servers on compromised hosts and connect remotely to execute commands or exfiltrate data.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection might not cover encrypted VNC traffic without additional decryption capabilities.
- **Assumptions:** It assumes that all legitimate VNC usage is known and documented, which may not always be the case in dynamic environments.

## False Positives

Potential false positives include:

- Legitimate administrative use of VNC for remote support or management.
- Software applications using VNC internally without malicious intent.

## Priority

**Priority Level: High**

Justification: VNC can provide deep access to a system, enabling significant lateral movement and data exfiltration. The ability to bypass traditional security controls makes it a critical threat vector.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Prepare a controlled test environment with a Windows host.
   
2. **Install VNC Server:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows, download and install a VNC server like TightVNC or RealVNC.
   ```

3. **Enable VNC Service:**
   - Configure the VNC server to start automatically and listen on a non-standard port (e.g., 5910) to avoid typical detection.

4. **Simulate Adversarial Activity:**
   - Connect from another machine using:
     ```bash
     vncviewer -connect <test_host_ip>:5910
     ```
   - Perform actions that mimic adversarial behavior, such as accessing sensitive directories or modifying system configurations.

5. **Monitor and Validate Alerts:**
   - Ensure network monitoring tools are capturing the traffic.
   - Verify that alerts are triggered by the simulated VNC session.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Verify Legitimacy:**
   - Confirm if the VNC activity is authorized or part of a known administrative process.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further lateral movement.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and intent of the VNC usage.
   - Review logs for any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).

4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove unauthorized VNC servers or clients.
   - Update security policies to restrict unauthorized VNC access.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings and actions taken for compliance and future reference.
