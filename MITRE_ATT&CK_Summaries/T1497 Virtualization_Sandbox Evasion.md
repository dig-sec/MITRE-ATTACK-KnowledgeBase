# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using containers as a form of obfuscation.

## Strategy Abstract
This strategy focuses on detecting abnormal behavior related to the use of containerization technologies that may indicate an adversary's attempt to evade detection. The primary data sources include network traffic logs, container orchestration platform metrics (e.g., Kubernetes), and endpoint security telemetry. Patterns analyzed involve unusual network communications from containers, unexpected creation or modification of containers, and discrepancies between declared and actual usage of resources.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may leverage containers to evade detection by executing malicious activities within isolated environments that are harder for traditional defenses to monitor. This technique can be observed in real-world scenarios where attackers deploy malware inside a container, which communicates with external command-and-control servers or exfiltrates data through unconventional channels. Adversary emulation details include using tools like Docker or Kubernetes to spin up containers dynamically and initiate connections to known malicious domains.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss sophisticated techniques where adversaries use legitimate container orchestration activities as a cover.
  - Lack of visibility into encrypted traffic within the container network can obscure detection efforts.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that baseline behavior profiles for containers are well-established and monitored.
  - Assumes that all endpoints in the environment have integrated telemetry collection capabilities.

## False Positives
Potential false positives could arise from:
- Legitimate development or testing environments using container technologies extensively.
- Automated deployments or updates managed by DevOps pipelines that temporarily create numerous containers.
- Network anomalies caused by misconfigured network policies within container orchestrators.

## Priority
The priority of this detection strategy is **High**. Containers are increasingly popular for both legitimate use and as a method to bypass security controls, making it crucial to detect such evasion techniques promptly to mitigate potential threats effectively.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no detailed adversary emulation steps are available. Future efforts should focus on creating test scenarios where containers are used in typical adversarial manners, such as setting up command-and-control infrastructure within container networks or using containers to obfuscate malware execution paths.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify the legitimacy of the container activity and cross-reference with known good baselines.
2. **Containment:** Isolate suspicious containers from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Collect logs and telemetry for deeper analysis to understand the scope and intent of the activity.
4. **Remediation:** Remove any malicious container deployments and patch vulnerabilities that allowed evasion.

## Additional Resources
No additional resources are currently available. Further research into emerging container security practices and threat intelligence regarding container-based attacks is recommended to enhance this strategy.
