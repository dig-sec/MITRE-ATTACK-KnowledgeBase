# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. The primary focus is on identifying and mitigating unauthorized access or anomalies that may indicate a compromise within containerized environments.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1110 - Brute Force
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows, Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Google Workspace, Containers

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of log data from container orchestration platforms (such as Kubernetes), host system logs, and network traffic analysis to identify patterns indicative of brute force attempts or credential access techniques. The primary data sources include:
- Container runtime logs
- Network traffic captures
- Authentication logs

Patterns analyzed include repeated failed login attempts, unusual process executions within containers, and anomalous network connections between containerized applications.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in container management tools or use misconfigured permissions to gain unauthorized access. Common tactics involve:
- Exploiting weak credentials
- Leveraging exposed APIs
- Using compromised accounts

Example commands for adversary emulation might include attempts to log into a container using known common passwords or exploiting default configurations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes all containers are part of a managed orchestration platform.
- May not detect zero-day exploits targeting specific vulnerabilities in container software.
- Relies on comprehensive logging and monitoring being enabled across the environment.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate automated scripts or tools that perform repeated access attempts for maintenance purposes.
- Misconfigured applications that generate excessive failed login attempts during testing phases.

## Priority
**High**: Container environments are increasingly targeted due to their scalability and often less stringent security postures compared to traditional infrastructures. The potential impact of a successful breach can be significant, affecting multiple services or data repositories.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should quickly assess the scope of the alert by reviewing logs and network traffic related to the affected container.
2. **Containment Measures:** If malicious activity is confirmed, isolate the compromised container from the rest of the environment.
3. **Credential Review:** Promptly change passwords or tokens associated with the impacted accounts.
4. **Incident Documentation:** Record all findings and actions taken for future reference and improvement of security measures.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available beyond standard industry best practices for container security and monitoring tools documentation.
