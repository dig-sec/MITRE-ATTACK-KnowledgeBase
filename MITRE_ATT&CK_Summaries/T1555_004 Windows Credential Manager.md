# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Windows Credential Manager

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that exploit Windows Credential Manager (WCM) to bypass security monitoring systems, specifically through credential dumping techniques.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1555.004 - Windows Credential Manager
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows

For more details on the technique, refer to [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/004).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources including process monitoring tools, network traffic analysis, and PowerShell command logging. It focuses on identifying patterns such as unauthorized access to credential stores using tools like VaultCmd or WinPwn.

Key elements analyzed include:
- Unusual process creation events involving known credential dumping utilities.
- Suspicious PowerShell commands aimed at extracting credentials from WCM.
- Network traffic anomalies associated with remote exploitation attempts of WCM.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit Windows Credential Manager to extract stored credentials by using tools such as VaultCmd and WinPwn. These tools are capable of enumerating and dumping credentials stored locally, which can then be used for lateral movement within a network or unauthorized access to sensitive systems.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **VaultCmd Access:** Typically executed via command-line interfaces to dump WCM-stored credentials.
- **WinPwn Command Execution:** Uses PowerShell to invoke the `Invoke-WCMDump` function, effectively extracting credential information for further exploitation.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
### Known Limitations:
- Detection mechanisms might miss highly obfuscated commands or those that mimic legitimate administrative activity.
- The strategy assumes all instances of VaultCmd and WinPwn are malicious if executed without proper authorization.

### Gaps:
- Limited effectiveness against novel tools not previously identified in threat intelligence databases.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that may trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate system administrators performing routine credential management tasks.
- Deployment of automated scripts for IT maintenance that inadvertently use these tools.
  
Regular audits and whitelisting practices should be in place to mitigate such occurrences.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

Justification: Credential access is a critical phase in the adversary lifecycle, enabling further exploitation and movement within compromised environments. Detecting and preventing this step can significantly reduce the impact of an attack.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy in a controlled test environment:

1. **Access Saved Credentials via VaultCmd:**
   - Install `VaultCmd` on a Windows machine.
   - Execute `vaultcmd /export` to list and dump credentials from WCM.

2. **WinPwn - Loot Local Credentials:**
   - Deploy WinPwn toolset in the test environment.
   - Run the PowerShell command `Invoke-WCMDump` to extract credentials stored in WCM.

Ensure that these activities are closely monitored for alert validation.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- Immediately isolate affected systems from the network to prevent lateral movement.
- Analyze logs and collected data to confirm the legitimacy of the activity.
- If confirmed as malicious, follow incident response protocols including forensics, eradication, and recovery measures.

Engage with cybersecurity teams for further investigation and remediation efforts.

## Additional Resources
For additional context and resources, consider exploring:
- **PowerShell Download and Execution Cradles:** Understand how PowerShell is used in adversarial contexts.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Invocations - Specific - ProcessCreation:** Analyze unexpected process creations linked to credential dumping activities.
- **Windows Credential Manager Access via VaultCmd:** Detailed insights into how VaultCmd operates within the Windows environment.

These resources provide a deeper understanding of potential adversarial tactics and enhance detection capabilities.
