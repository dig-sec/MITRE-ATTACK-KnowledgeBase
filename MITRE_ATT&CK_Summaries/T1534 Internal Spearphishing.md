# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify and alert on adversarial attempts that utilize containers to bypass traditional security monitoring mechanisms. This involves recognizing containerized environments being used for malicious activities such as command and control, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources such as container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), network traffic analysis, and endpoint monitoring to identify suspicious patterns. Key indicators include unusual container activities like unexpected image pulls from unauthorized registries, unexpected communication with external IP addresses, or the presence of known malicious binaries within containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers to conceal their activities due to their lightweight nature and ease of deployment. In real-world scenarios, attackers may deploy malware inside a container, using it as an execution environment that is difficult for traditional security tools to detect. They might also exploit misconfigurations in the container orchestration platform or leverage privileged containers to gain unauthorized access.

Adversary emulation involves setting up a benign containerized environment and simulating malicious activities such as:
- Pulling images from non-standard repositories.
- Establishing connections to suspicious IP addresses.
- Running known malware binaries within containers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Encrypted network traffic within containerized environments that cannot be inspected by traditional methods.
  - Containers running in highly dynamic environments where baseline behavior is hard to establish.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Container orchestration platforms are configured with sufficient logging and monitoring capabilities.
  - Security teams have access to endpoint detection tools capable of inspecting container activity.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of containers for testing purposes that mimic suspicious activities.
- Misconfigurations in the network or security policies leading to benign alerts.
- Authorized but unusual communication patterns, such as during large-scale data migrations or deployments.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass traditional monitoring using containers presents a significant risk, especially if adversaries can leverage privileged access within containerized environments. Early detection is crucial to prevent lateral movement and potential data breaches.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:
1. Set up a minimal container orchestration platform such as Kubernetes.
2. Deploy a benign application that mimics suspicious activity patterns, including pulling images from unauthorized registries and establishing connections with external IPs.
3. Observe if the detection strategy triggers alerts on these activities.

## Response
Guidelines for analysts when the alert fires:
1. **Investigate Container Activity:** Examine logs to identify which containers are involved and review their activities, such as image pulls or network connections.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network traffic associated with suspicious container activities to determine if it matches known malicious patterns.
3. **Isolate Affected Containers:** Contain and isolate any containers identified as potentially compromised to prevent further spread of malicious activity.
4. **Update Security Policies:** Review and update security policies related to container usage to address detected vulnerabilities.
