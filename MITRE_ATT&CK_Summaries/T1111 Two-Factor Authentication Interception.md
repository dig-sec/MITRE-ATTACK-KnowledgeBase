# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to utilize containers as a means to bypass security monitoring and detection systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1218 - Signed Binary Proxy Execution Environment
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container usage patterns that deviate from normal operations. Key data sources include:

- Container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker)
- System logs (auditd, syslog)
- Network traffic

Patterns analyzed involve unexpected or unauthorized creation of containers, unusual network communication originating from containers, and abnormal resource utilization.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to execute malicious code while avoiding detection by traditional security tools. Containers can be used for command-and-control (C2) activities due to their ability to isolate processes and obfuscate execution. Common adversary techniques include:

- Deploying malware within a container that mimics legitimate software.
- Using containers to tunnel network traffic through encrypted channels.

Adversary emulation might involve commands like:
```bash
docker run -d --name malicious_container <malicious_image>
kubectl create deployment exploit-deploy --image=<exploit_image>
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all container activity is logged adequately.
- May not detect sophisticated obfuscation techniques used within containers.
- Relies on the assumption that baseline behavior is well-understood.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate use of containers for testing or development.
- Temporary spikes in resource usage due to legitimate workload increases.
- Scheduled maintenance activities involving container deployment.

## Priority
**High**: Containers are increasingly used both by organizations and adversaries, making their misuse a significant threat vector. The ability to bypass traditional monitoring poses severe risks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Since specific adversary emulation instructions are not available, the following steps can be considered for testing:

1. Set up a controlled environment with container orchestration tools.
2. Deploy benign containers and establish normal operational baselines.
3. Introduce known adversarial patterns within containers to test detection capabilities.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- **Investigate**: Review logs and network traffic associated with the flagged container activity.
- **Containment**: Isolate suspicious containers from production environments to prevent further spread or damage.
- **Remediation**: Remove unauthorized containers and apply patches or updates as necessary.
- **Reporting**: Document findings and share with relevant stakeholders for policy adjustment.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context will be developed as more information becomes available on container-based adversarial techniques.
