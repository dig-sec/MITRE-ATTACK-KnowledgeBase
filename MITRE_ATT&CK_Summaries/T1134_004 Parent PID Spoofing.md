# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS): Parent PID Spoofing

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems using parent process ID (PID) spoofing on Windows platforms.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages process monitoring data to identify anomalies in parent-child process relationships. Key data sources include system logs and process creation events captured through security information and event management (SIEM) tools.

The strategy involves analyzing:
- Unexpected changes in the reported parent PID of a process.
- Processes spawned by unusual or non-standard parents, particularly if they coincide with known malicious activity patterns.
- Discrepancies between expected and observed process hierarchies that could indicate an attempt to evade detection.

## Technical Context
Parent PID Spoofing is executed by adversaries to mislead security monitoring tools into associating a suspicious child process with a legitimate parent process. This tactic helps attackers hide their activities from defenders who rely on hierarchical relationships between processes for threat detection.

In real-world scenarios, this technique might be implemented using PowerShell or other scripting methods to manipulate the reported parent PID of a process. Adversaries can use built-in Windows commands and APIs to execute these actions without needing additional tools.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover all variants of spoofing if adversaries alter their approach or exploit lesser-known system features.
  - This strategy assumes that security monitoring is sufficiently comprehensive to capture relevant process events.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Security tools have access to detailed process creation data, including parent-child relationships.
  - System logs and event management solutions are configured to capture necessary information for analysis.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software updates or patches that change parent-child process dynamics temporarily.
- System maintenance tasks or scripts executed with elevated privileges that alter process hierarchies.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Parent PID Spoofing is a sophisticated technique employed by advanced adversaries to evade detection mechanisms. Its successful execution can significantly undermine defense systems, allowing further exploitation and privilege escalation within the target environment.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell:**
   - Use PowerShell to create a process with a spoofed parent PID:
     ```powershell
     $process = Start-Process powershell.exe -PassThru
     Set-PsProcess -Id $process.Id -ParentId (Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq "svchost" }).Id
     ```

2. **Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process:**
   - Execute a command that sets the parent of a newly spawned process to the current process:
     ```cmd
     start /b cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 -t > nul & setpriority.exe 0xffffffff
     ```

3. **Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process:**
   - Use a tool like `Process Hacker` to manually change the parent of a running process.

4. **Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe:**
   - Launch a process with `svchost.exe` as its parent:
     ```cmd
     start /b cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 -t > nul & setpriority.exe 0x4
     ```

5. **Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process:**
   - Create a new process and immediately assign it as the parent of another:
     ```cmd
     start "" cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 -t > nul & timeout /T 1 & setpriority.exe 0x5
     ```

## Response
When an alert for Parent PID Spoofing is triggered, analysts should:

- Verify the legitimacy of both parent and child processes involved.
- Investigate the context in which the process was created, including user activity logs and network connections.
- Assess whether the detected anomaly aligns with known threat indicators or patterns.
- If malicious intent is confirmed, escalate according to incident response protocols, including containment and remediation steps.
