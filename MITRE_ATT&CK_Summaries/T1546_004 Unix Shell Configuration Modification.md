# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to modify Unix shell configurations as part of a strategy to achieve persistence and privilege escalation on Linux and macOS systems.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1546.004 - Unix Shell Configuration Modification
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy focuses on identifying unauthorized modifications to Unix shell configuration files, which are commonly targeted by adversaries to establish persistence and escalate privileges. The primary data sources include:

1. **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitors changes in critical configuration files such as `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.shrc`, and system-level profiles like `/etc/profile` or `/etc/bash.bashrc`.
2. **Log Analysis:** Examines logs for unauthorized access to shell profile directories (`/home`, `/root`, `/etc`) and unusual command execution patterns.
3. **Behavioral Analytics:** Detects anomalous behavior indicative of privilege escalation attempts, such as scripts executed from unexpected locations.

Patterns analyzed include unexpected changes in file hashes, unauthorized modification timestamps, and the presence of malicious commands within shell profiles.

## Technical Context

Adversaries exploit Unix shell configuration files to maintain persistence by embedding malicious commands that execute upon user login. This technique allows them to evade detection by executing code discreetly as part of legitimate system processes. Common methods include:

- Modifying `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or other shell initialization scripts.
- Appending commands directly into the system-wide shell configuration files like `/etc/profile`.
- Creating new malicious scripts and linking them within user profiles.

Adversary emulation involves simulating these modifications to understand potential detection paths. Sample commands for emulation include:

```bash
echo "malicious_command" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PATH=/malicious/path:$PATH" >> /etc/profile
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover obfuscated or encoded command injections.
  - Techniques relying on ephemeral file changes (e.g., using RAM disks) might evade FIM.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that baseline behavior for shell configurations is well-defined and monitored.
  - Relies on comprehensive logging of all user activities within the system environment.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative tasks involving updates to shell profiles.
- Software installation scripts modifying configuration files as part of setup processes.
- User customization or personalization of their shell environment.

False positives can be minimized by correlating alerts with other indicators of compromise and analyzing user context.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

Justification:
- Modifying shell configurations directly impacts system integrity and security posture, enabling persistent access for adversaries.
- Early detection is crucial to prevent further escalation or data exfiltration activities.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **Add command to .bash_profile:**
   ```bash
   echo "echo 'Test' >> ~/test.log" >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

2. **Add command to .bashrc:**
   ```bash
   echo "echo 'Test' >> ~/test.log" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. **Add command to .shrc:**
   ```bash
   echo "echo 'Test' >> ~/test.log" >> ~/.shrc
   ```

4. **Append to the system shell profile:**
   ```bash
   sudo echo "export PATH=/tmp:$PATH" >> /etc/profile
   ```

5. **Append commands user shell profile:**
   ```bash
   echo "echo 'Test' >> ~/test.log" >> ~/.profile
   ```

6. **System shell profile scripts:**
   ```bash
   sudo echo "echo 'Test' >> /var/log/test.log" >> /etc/bash.bashrc
   ```

7. **Create/Append to .bash_logout:**
   ```bash
   echo "echo 'Session ended at $(date)' >> ~/logout.log" >> ~/.bash_logout
   ```

## Response

When an alert fires:

1. Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.
2. Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the modified configuration files and logs.
3. Identify any executed commands or scripts triggered by these modifications.
4. Revert changes to shell profiles to their original state.
5. Review user access permissions and audit trails for suspicious activities.
6. Update detection rules based on findings to improve future response.
