# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to utilize cloud infrastructure as a resource in preparation for executing attacks. This includes activities related to setting up and managing resources such as virtual machines, containers, storage, and networking components in the cloud environment.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of log data sources, including cloud infrastructure logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs), network traffic analysis, and user activity monitoring. The key patterns analyzed include unusual resource provisioning activities that deviate from normal baseline behaviors, such as the rapid creation or modification of resources by unauthorized accounts.

The strategy employs machine learning models to establish baselines for typical resource usage patterns. Anomalies are flagged when deviations occur, suggesting potential adversarial exploitation of cloud resources. Additional rules are applied to detect known malicious configurations or scripts being deployed within the cloud environment.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit cloud environments by rapidly provisioning resources to host command and control servers, exfiltrate data, or perform lateral movement across networks. They may use compromised credentials to gain initial access and then escalate privileges to create new accounts with administrative permissions. These activities are typically stealthy, using legitimate tools provided by the cloud platform.

Common adversary techniques include:
- Rapid creation of virtual machines
- Modification of firewall rules to allow unauthorized traffic
- Use of container orchestration services like Kubernetes for scaling malicious workloads

Adversary emulation might involve using tools like AWS CLI or Azure PowerShell to script the automated setup and teardown of resources, mimicking the actions an adversary would take.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** The strategy may not detect low-and-slow provisioning activities that mimic legitimate usage patterns.
- **Assumption:** Baseline behavior models are accurate reflections of normal activity and can be effectively updated to adapt to evolving cloud usage patterns.
- **Gap:** Detection is less effective if adversaries use multi-cloud strategies, as it relies on single-platform log sources.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate IT operations involving rapid provisioning for new projects or deployments.
- Misconfigured alert rules leading to notifications during routine maintenance activities.
- User errors resulting in unexpected resource creation or modification.

Organizations should calibrate detection thresholds and continuously refine baselines to minimize false positives while maintaining sensitivity to actual threats.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Cloud environments are increasingly targeted by adversaries due to their flexibility, scalability, and the wealth of data they contain. The ability for adversaries to rapidly provision resources can lead to significant security breaches if not promptly detected and mitigated. Early detection is crucial in preventing large-scale incidents.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Verification:** Confirm whether the activity aligns with known scheduled tasks or legitimate operations.
2. **Investigation:** Analyze logs for any signs of unauthorized access, such as unfamiliar IP addresses or unusual login times.
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected resources to prevent further spread or data exfiltration. This may involve revoking permissions or deleting suspicious instances.
4. **Eradication:** Identify and eliminate the root cause of the threat, which could include patching vulnerabilities or removing compromised credentials.
5. **Recovery:** Restore any impacted services or data from backups and ensure all security measures are reinforced.
