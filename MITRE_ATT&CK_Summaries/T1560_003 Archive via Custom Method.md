# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. It focuses on identifying instances where adversaries leverage container technology to obscure their activities and evade detection mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of data sources including container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes), host-level logs, and network traffic to identify suspicious activity. Patterns analyzed include unusual container creation/deletion events, anomalous resource allocation requests, and unexpected network communications originating from containers. Anomalies in these patterns can indicate adversarial behavior attempting to exploit the flexibility and isolation properties of containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers as a means to compartmentalize malicious activities, making it harder for security tools to track their operations across different segments of an infrastructure. Techniques include deploying malware within container images, using containers to exfiltrate data, or leveraging sidecar containers to maintain persistence. Adversary emulation might involve commands such as `docker run` with custom network settings or mounting host directories to bypass monitoring.

### Example Commands:
- Running a compromised container: `docker run -d --network=host <image>`
- Mounting host filesystem for persistence: `docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** Detection might miss sophisticated adversaries who use encrypted communication channels within containers.
- **Assumption:** The monitoring tools have full visibility of container orchestrator logs and network traffic, which may not be true in all environments.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate DevOps activities involving rapid container deployment/teardown cycles.
- High-volume CI/CD pipelines creating numerous containers for testing purposes.
- Network configurations where internal services legitimately use host networking modes.

## Priority
**Severity:** Medium  
Justification: While the exploitation of containers presents a significant risk, its impact is context-dependent. The priority is medium due to the relatively advanced nature required for effective adversarial execution, balanced against the criticality of container-based systems in modern infrastructures.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
- **Step 1:** Set up a test environment with a running instance of Docker or Kubernetes.
- **Step 2:** Deploy a benign container and monitor baseline activity using existing security tools.
- **Step 3:** Attempt to execute an adversarial command like `docker run --network=host <image>` from within the test environment while observing logs for detection patterns.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Assessment:** Evaluate the context of container activities, including resource usage and network traffic.
2. **Investigation:** Correlate with other security alerts or logs to confirm malicious intent.
3. **Containment:** Isolate suspicious containers by disconnecting them from the network or stopping them.
4. **Remediation:** Analyze container images for vulnerabilities or malicious code, apply necessary patches, and update security policies.
