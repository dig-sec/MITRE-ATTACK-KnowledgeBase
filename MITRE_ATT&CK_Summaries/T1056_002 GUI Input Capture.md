# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial GUI Input Capture Attempts

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by capturing GUI inputs such as passwords and other sensitive information entered through graphical user interfaces.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1056.002 - GUI Input Capture
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Collection, Credential Access
- **Platforms:** macOS, Windows, Linux

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring for abnormal activities associated with GUI input capture across multiple platforms. Key data sources include:

- **Event Logs**: System and application logs to identify suspicious scripts or tools.
- **Process Monitoring**: Observation of unexpected processes that might execute scripts designed to capture inputs.
- **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)**: Analyzing deviations from normal user behavior patterns, such as unexpected access attempts during off-hours.

Patterns analyzed include unusual script executions, abnormal GUI interactions, and any unauthorized elevation of privileges related to input capturing tools or utilities.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often execute GUI input capture by deploying scripts or malicious applications that prompt users for credentials or other sensitive information. These methods can be executed through:

- **AppleScript** on macOS: Scripts that utilize GUI scripting capabilities to capture user inputs.
- **PowerShell** on Windows: Scripts designed to create fake credential dialogs and capture user entries.

### Adversary Emulation Details
#### Sample Commands
- **AppleScript - Prompt User for Password**
  ```applescript
  do shell script "echo 'Enter your password:' | dialog --password"
  ```

- **PowerShell - Prompt User for Password**
  ```powershell
  $password = Read-Host "Enter your password:" -AsSecureString
  ```

- **AppleScript - Spoofing a credential prompt using osascript**
  ```applescript
  tell application "System Events"
      keystroke "Password: "
      delay 1
      keystroke return
      delay 1
      keystroke the clipboard
      delay 1
      keystroke return
  end tell
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot**: Legitimate applications that require similar interactions may not be distinguishable from malicious ones without additional context.
- **Assumption**: The presence of a script or process is indicative of potential GUI input capture attempts, which may overlook sophisticated evasion techniques.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative tools prompting for credentials during routine maintenance tasks.
- User scripts designed to automate benign workflows.
- Applications performing expected user interactions as part of their functionality.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: GUI input capture poses a significant risk as it directly targets the acquisition of sensitive information, such as credentials and confidential data. The potential for misuse is high, making prompt detection crucial.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

1. **AppleScript - Prompt User for Password**
   - Run the script on a macOS system to simulate credential prompting.
   
2. **PowerShell - Prompt User for Password**
   - Execute the PowerShell command on a Windows machine to create a fake password prompt.

3. **AppleScript - Spoofing a Credential Prompt**
   - Implement the osascript-based AppleScript to mimic unauthorized credential collection in macOS environments.

Ensure that these scripts are executed within a controlled environment, using test credentials and isolated systems.

## Response
When an alert for GUI input capture is triggered:

1. **Isolate Affected Systems**: Immediately disconnect the system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
2. **Analyze Logs**: Review relevant logs for additional evidence of malicious activity or scripts executed around the time of detection.
3. **User Notification**: Inform affected users and verify if any suspicious prompts were encountered.
4. **Remediation**: Remove any identified malicious scripts or applications from the system.
5. **Follow-up Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope and impact of the incident.
