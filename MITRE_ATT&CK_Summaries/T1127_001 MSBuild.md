# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers by leveraging MSBuildâ€”a widely-used build automation tool in the .NET ecosystem. Specifically, we focus on detecting misuse of MSBuild capabilities that adversaries might exploit for executing malicious code or evading detection.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1127.001 - MSBuild
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127/001)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing the execution of MSBuild tasks, particularly focusing on inline task definitions which can be a vector for executing malicious code. The data sources used include Windows event logs (e.g., Application Logs), process creation events (Process Tracker), and file integrity monitoring alerts.

Patterns analyzed involve:
- Detection of new or modified MSBuild XML files.
- Monitoring the execution of MSBuild.exe with suspicious inline tasks.
- Correlating MSBuild task executions with unusual file modifications or access patterns in sensitive directories.

The strategy utilizes correlation rules to detect deviations from normal build processes that may indicate evasion attempts.

## Technical Context

Adversaries can exploit MSBuild by embedding malicious scripts within project files or defining inline tasks using languages like C# and VB. This allows them to execute arbitrary code during the build process, often bypassing traditional security controls because these actions might appear as legitimate development activities.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Inline task defined in MSBuild XML:
    ```xml
    <UsingTask TaskName="InvokeMaliciousCode" TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory" AssemblyFile="$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v4.0.dll">
      <ParameterGroup>
        <InputParameter ParameterType="System.String" />
      </ParameterGroup>
      <Task>
        <Reference Include="mscorlib" />
        <Using Namespace="System" />
        <Using Namespace="System.Diagnostics" />
        <Code Type="Fragment" Language="cs">
          <![CDATA[
            Log.LogMessage(MessageImportance.High, "Executing malicious code");
            System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c echo Malicious activity started");
          ]]>
        </Code>
      </Task>
    </UsingTask>
    
    <Target Name="MaliciousActivity">
      <InvokeMaliciousCode InputParameter="Test" />
    </Target>
  ```

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Create a sample MSBuild project with an inline task that executes a benign command (e.g., `echo` or `ping localhost`).
  - Trigger the build process in a controlled environment to simulate adversary behavior.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Limited visibility into encrypted or obfuscated MSBuild files.
  - Difficulty distinguishing between legitimate complex builds and malicious ones without context.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Organizations using MSBuild for development are assumed to have consistent build patterns that can be learned over time.
  - Security tools already in place will capture relevant logs needed for this detection strategy.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of MSBuild for complex builds involving custom tasks or scripts, particularly in large enterprise environments with diverse development practices.
- Developers using inline task definitions to enhance build automation as part of standard software development processes.

## Priority
**High.** The severity is high because evasion techniques that bypass detection controls can enable adversaries to maintain persistence and exfiltrate sensitive data without being discovered.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-step Instructions

#### MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#)
1. **Setup:**
   - Create an MSBuild project file (`Example.proj`) with the following content:
     ```xml
     <Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
       <UsingTask TaskName="ExecuteMaliciousCode" TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory"
                  AssemblyFile="$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v4.0.dll">
         <ParameterGroup>
           <Message ParameterType="System.String" />
         </ParameterGroup>
         <Task>
           <Reference Include="mscorlib" />
           <Using Namespace="System.Diagnostics" />
           <Code Type="Fragment" Language="cs">
             <![CDATA[
               Log.LogMessage(MessageImportance.High, Message);
               Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c echo This is a test of malicious execution");
             ]]>
           </Code>
         </Task>
       </UsingTask>

       <Target Name="Execute">
         <ExecuteMaliciousCode Message="Executing inline task" />
       </Target>
     </Project>
     ```
2. **Execution:**
   - Run the build command in a Windows environment:
     ```bash
     msbuild Example.proj
     ```

#### MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB)
1. **Setup:**
   - Create an MSBuild project file (`ExampleProj.vbproj`) with the following content:
     ```xml
     <Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
       <UsingTask TaskName="MaliciousAction" TaskFactory="CodeTaskFactory"
                  AssemblyFile="$(MSBuildToolsPath)\Microsoft.Build.Tasks.v4.0.dll">
         <ParameterGroup>
           <Info ParameterType="System.String" />
         </ParameterGroup>
         <Task>
           <Reference Include="mscorlib" />
           <Using Namespace="System.Diagnostics" />
           <Code Type="Fragment" Language="vb">
             <![CDATA[
               Log.LogMessage(MessageImportance.High, Info)
               Process.Start("cmd.exe", "/c echo VB malicious execution test")
             ]]>
           </Code>
         </Task>
       </UsingTask>

       <Target Name="Action">
         <MaliciousAction Info="Running VB inline task" />
       </Target>
     </Project>
     ```
2. **Execution:**
   - Run the build command in a Windows environment:
     ```bash
     msbuild ExampleProj.vbproj
     ```

## Response

When an alert for this technique fires, analysts should:

1. Verify whether the MSBuild execution context is legitimate by reviewing recent changes to project files and correlating with known development activities.
2. Examine the executed tasks in detail to identify any potentially malicious inline code.
3. Assess any associated processes or network activity that might indicate further suspicious behavior.
4. Collaborate with software developers to understand if there are any benign reasons for the observed MSBuild task execution patterns.
