# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detecting SQL Stored Procedures for Persistence (T1505.001)

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts that leverage SQL stored procedures to establish persistence within an organization's network. By monitoring and detecting these activities, organizations can thwart adversaries' efforts to maintain unauthorized access through persistent mechanisms.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1505.001 - SQL Stored Procedures
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy aims to identify the use of SQL stored procedures as a method for maintaining persistence. Key data sources include database audit logs, network traffic analysis, and endpoint monitoring systems. Patterns analyzed involve unusual or unauthorized creation, modification, or execution of stored procedures that could indicate malicious activity.

### Data Sources Utilized:
- **Database Audit Logs:** Monitoring for unexpected changes in stored procedures.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identifying anomalous SQL queries indicative of persistence attempts.
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Detecting process executions linked to database access or manipulation.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Creation of new stored procedures from unauthorized accounts.
- Modification of existing procedures that deviate from established patterns.
- Execution of suspicious stored procedures, particularly during off-hours.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use SQL stored procedures for persistence by embedding malicious logic within these procedures. Once installed, they can be executed automatically to maintain access or perform additional tasks without direct interaction with the adversary's systems. Real-world execution may involve:
- Modifying existing procedures.
- Creating new ones that execute harmful scripts.
- Using backdoor accounts with sufficient permissions.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries might use commands like:
```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.MaliciousProcedure AS BEGIN EXEC xp_cmdshell 'malicious_command' END;
```
Test scenarios could include simulating the creation and execution of such procedures from non-administrative accounts.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Lack of visibility into obfuscated or encoded SQL scripts.
  - Difficulty in distinguishing between benign and malicious stored procedure activities without context.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes baseline knowledge of normal behavior for stored procedures within the environment.
  - Relies on comprehensive database audit logging being enabled.

## False Positives
Potential false positives may arise from:
- Legitimate administrative changes to stored procedures.
- Scheduled maintenance tasks that involve modifications or executions of SQL scripts.
- Automated testing environments executing procedures as part of routine checks.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: SQL stored procedures can be used for sophisticated persistence mechanisms, allowing adversaries prolonged access. The ability to evade detection while maintaining control poses a significant risk to organizational security.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
*None available*

## Response
When an alert is triggered indicating potential misuse of SQL stored procedures:
1. **Investigate the Alert:** Verify the legitimacy of changes or executions in stored procedure activities.
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine if any data exfiltration, system manipulation, or unauthorized access occurred.
3. **Containment:** Disable suspicious stored procedures and restrict database access for implicated accounts.
4. **Remediation:** Restore affected databases from backups if necessary and update security policies to prevent recurrence.
5. **Reporting:** Document the incident details, response actions taken, and any lessons learned.
