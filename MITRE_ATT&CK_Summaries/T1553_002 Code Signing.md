# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: Detect Adversarial Use of Code Signing to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that exploit code signing mechanisms to bypass security monitoring systems across both macOS and Windows platforms.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1553.002 - Code Signing
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing various data sources such as system logs, application execution logs, and certificate management events. The focus is on identifying unusual or unauthorized code signing activities that could indicate an adversarial attempt to disguise malicious payloads as legitimate software.

Key patterns include:
- Detection of unsigned applications running with elevated privileges.
- Monitoring for unexpected changes in digital certificates.
- Tracking unusual file modification times coinciding with new executable deployments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often exploit code signing by obtaining valid digital signatures, either through compromised certificate authorities or social engineering tactics. In the real world, attackers might:

1. **Create a Malicious Application**: Develop malware and sign it using stolen or self-generated certificates.
2. **Deploy Signed Malware**: Distribute this signed application to targets, often via phishing emails or malicious websites.

Adversary emulation details:
- Adversaries may use commands like `codesign` on macOS to apply their own signatures to executables without proper verification.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** All legitimate code signing activity is registered with IT security teams.
- **Blind Spot:** Detection relies heavily on logging integrity; gaps in log collection can lead to missed detections.
- **Assumption:** Organizations have up-to-date threat intelligence regarding known malicious certificates.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Legitimate software updates that involve new code signing.
- Internal development teams using self-signed certificates for testing purposes without proper documentation.

These activities might trigger alerts if they fall outside predefined parameters or thresholds.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification:
- Code signing is a powerful mechanism to bypass security defenses, and misuse can lead to significant breaches.
- The potential impact includes unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data exfiltration.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no step-by-step instructions available for adversary emulation within this report. Organizations should consider developing tailored scenarios based on their environment and threat landscape.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
1. **Verify the Integrity of Signed Applications**: Confirm whether the code was signed with a trusted certificate.
2. **Assess Certificate Validity**: Check if any certificates used were revoked or unauthorized.
3. **Investigate Deployment Channels**: Determine how and where the application was distributed to assess potential exposure.
4. **Contain and Remediate**: Isolate affected systems and remove malicious applications promptly.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references are provided within this report framework. It is recommended that organizations consult their internal security policies and external threat intelligence feeds for further context.
