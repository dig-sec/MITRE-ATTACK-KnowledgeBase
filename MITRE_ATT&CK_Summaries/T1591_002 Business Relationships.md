# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts that aim to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. This can involve adversaries using containers as a means to hide malicious activities, evade detection mechanisms, or exploit container vulnerabilities for unauthorized access.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing container-related activities within a network. Key data sources include:
- Container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Network traffic between containers
- System and application logs

Patterns analyzed for anomalies include unusual container creation/deletion rates, unexpected inter-container communications, and irregular resource usage patterns that deviate from normal baselines.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to bypass traditional security monitoring by exploiting:
- Insufficient logging or monitoring in container environments
- Misconfigurations allowing privilege escalation within containers
- Network segmentation flaws enabling lateral movement

Real-world execution of this technique might involve adversaries deploying malicious code inside a benign-looking container or using containers as a sandboxing method to test exploits without detection.

### Adversary Emulation Details
While specific commands vary, common actions include:
- Deploying containers with escalated privileges.
- Establishing covert channels between containers and external systems.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Assumption:** Organizations have comprehensive logging enabled for container orchestration platforms.
- **Blind Spot:** Zero-day vulnerabilities in container technologies may not be immediately detectable.

## False Positives
Potential false positives could arise from:
- Legitimate development environments that frequently spin up containers during testing phases.
- Automated CI/CD pipelines that create and destroy containers as part of deployment processes.

## Priority
**Priority Level: High**

The potential for adversaries to exploit container environments to bypass security measures is significant. Containers are increasingly used in modern IT infrastructures, making them attractive targets. Effective detection strategies are crucial to mitigate associated risks.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available for adversary emulation of this technique. Future efforts should focus on developing a controlled test environment that simulates potential adversarial actions using containers.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating possible container-based evasion:
1. **Investigate**: Immediately review the logs related to the suspicious container activity.
2. **Isolate**: Quarantine affected containers and halt any unusual processes or communications.
3. **Analyze**: Determine if the activity is benign (e.g., part of a CI/CD pipeline) or malicious.
4. **Remediate**: If malicious, apply necessary patches, update configurations, and enhance monitoring to prevent recurrence.

## Additional Resources
Additional resources are currently not available. However, organizations should refer to container security best practices and continuous monitoring guidelines provided by leading cybersecurity frameworks and vendors.

This report outlines the strategy for detecting adversarial attempts using containers, emphasizing proactive measures and vigilance in managing containerized environments.
