# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to extract access tokens from cloud-based applications such as SaaS platforms, Office 365, Azure AD, and Google Workspace. By identifying unauthorized access token exfiltration, organizations can mitigate potential credential abuse and data breaches.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1528 - Steal Application Access Token
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** SaaS, Office 365, Azure AD, Google Workspace  
[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring and analyzing authentication logs, network traffic patterns, and application access anomalies. By correlating data from multiple sources such as Identity Providers (IdPs), endpoint detection systems, and cloud access security brokers (CASBs), the system identifies unusual or unauthorized token generation and usage events.

Key patterns include:
- Anomalous login locations
- Unusual time-of-day access attempts
- Excessive failed login attempts followed by success

## Technical Context
Adversaries often target cloud applications to steal tokens as a means of bypassing traditional network security measures. They might use phishing, malware, or exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication process.

**Execution Methods:**
1. **Phishing Attacks:** Trick users into providing credentials which are then used to generate access tokens.
2. **Malware:** Deployed on endpoints to capture and exfiltrate stored tokens.
3. **Exploiting Vulnerabilities:** Exploit weaknesses in application logic or APIs to extract tokens directly.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- Use PowerShell scripts to mimic token extraction from Azure AD.
- Simulate phishing campaigns to test detection mechanisms.
- Conduct controlled attacks using tools like Microburst for testing in non-production environments.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Encrypted traffic may conceal malicious activities, reducing visibility.
  - Zero-day exploits targeting authentication mechanisms may bypass current detections.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - The monitoring system has full visibility over all cloud application logs and network traffic.
  - Users have consistent behavior patterns that can be analyzed for anomalies.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate users accessing applications from new or unusual locations due to travel.
- Scheduled scripts running at non-standard times, which might mimic malicious activity.
- Increased login attempts during business onboarding processes or IT audits.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Access token theft can lead to significant data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. The potential impact includes compromised user accounts, data exfiltration, and lateral movement within an organization's network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment:

### Azure - Dump All Azure Key Vaults with Microburst

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Configure a non-production Azure environment.
   - Install Microburst toolset following official documentation.

2. **Authenticate to Azure:**
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. **Enumerate Subscriptions:**
   ```bash
   microburst enumerate-subscription --subscription <SubscriptionID>
   ```

4. **List All Key Vaults:**
   ```bash
   microburst list-keyvaults --subscription <SubscriptionID> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName>
   ```

5. **Dump Credentials for Each Key Vault:**
   For each listed Key Vault, execute:
   ```bash
   microburst dump-credentials --keyvault <KeyVaultName>
   ```

6. **Monitor Alerts:**
   - Ensure alerting mechanisms are active and test them with the above actions.
   - Analyze logs and alerts generated during emulation.

## Response
When an alert for stolen application access tokens fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify Alert Validity:** Confirm that the activity is not a false positive by reviewing user behavior history and recent changes in access patterns.

2. **Containment:**
   - Immediately revoke the compromised tokens.
   - If necessary, temporarily disable affected accounts to prevent further unauthorized actions.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into how the tokens were accessed or stolen.
   - Review logs for additional suspicious activities linked to the same source or method of compromise.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Patch any vulnerabilities identified during the investigation.
   - Update security policies and user training programs to mitigate similar threats in the future.

5. **Communication:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders about the incident and actions taken.
   - Provide an update on potential impacts and ongoing monitoring efforts.
