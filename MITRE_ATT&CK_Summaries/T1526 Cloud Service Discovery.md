# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting containerization technologies.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1526 - Cloud Service Discovery
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Discovery
- **Platforms:** Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Google Workspace

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages logs and telemetry from various cloud service platforms to identify patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. The primary data sources include Azure AD activity logs, Office 365 audit logs, and container management platform logs (e.g., Kubernetes events). Patterns analyzed involve unusual container provisioning activities, unexpected access to container registries, and unauthorized configuration changes in the cloud environment.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit containers to obfuscate their presence by using them as temporary environments for executing malicious payloads. In the real world, adversaries execute this technique by leveraging public or compromised credentials to spin up new containers, modify configurations stealthily, or inject malicious code into container images during build processes. 

### Adversary Emulation
Sample commands and scenarios include:
- Using `kubectl` commands to access unauthorized namespaces.
- Executing scripts that automate the deployment of containers with hidden payloads.
- Modifying Dockerfiles or CI/CD pipelines to introduce vulnerabilities.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not cover all container orchestration platforms equally, especially custom or less common solutions.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that logging mechanisms are fully enabled across the cloud environment. Some legitimate administrative activities might be flagged as malicious without additional context.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities include:
- Routine updates and patches to container images by trusted developers.
- Scheduled automated deployment processes initiated by DevOps teams.
- Legitimate use of containers for testing purposes in development environments.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The exploitation of containers poses a significant risk as they can serve as vehicles for deploying malware, exfiltrating data, or providing lateral movement within the network. Given their dynamic nature and widespread adoption, ensuring robust monitoring is critical to maintaining security posture.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst
1. Set up a test Azure environment.
2. Install MicroBurst (`pip install micr0bum`).
3. Run `microburst enumerate azuread --dump --output-dir <directory>` to extract subscription data.

### AWS - Enumerate Common Cloud Services
1. In an AWS account, use the AWS CLI to list services: `aws service-quotas list-service-quotas`.
2. Use tools like `CloudSploit` to scan for misconfigurations or unauthorized access.
3. Execute AWS-specific enumeration scripts with elevated permissions.

### Azure - Enumerate Common Cloud Services
1. Utilize `Azure CLI` (`az`) and authenticate using a valid service principal.
2. Run commands such as `az group list --query "[].{name:name}" --output table` to enumerate resource groups.
3. Use tools like `CloudShellBurst` for automated enumeration of Azure resources.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
1. Verify the source and context of container activities to determine legitimacy.
2. Investigate the associated user credentials and access controls.
3. Review recent changes in configuration or deployment processes.
4. Isolate affected containers to prevent potential data exfiltration or further compromise.
5. Update monitoring rules to reduce false positives while ensuring comprehensive coverage.
