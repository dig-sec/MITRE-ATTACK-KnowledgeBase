# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging containerization technologies. Specifically, it focuses on adversaries exploiting containers for privilege escalation and persistence.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1546.001 - Change Default File Association
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container activities on Windows platforms to identify unusual behavior that may indicate adversarial attempts to exploit containers. Key data sources include system logs, container orchestration platform logs (e.g., Kubernetes), and network traffic analysis. Patterns analyzed involve unexpected changes in default file associations within container environments, abnormal privilege escalations, or persistence mechanisms.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may execute this technique by deploying malicious containers that modify the default file association on a Windows host to bypass security controls or maintain access without detection. In practice, adversaries might use command-line tools or scripts to alter registry settings associated with file types and applications within container environments.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - Using PowerShell to change file associations: `assoc .exe=maliciousApp`
  - Modifying the Windows Registry via a script for persistence.
  
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a benign container and observe its behavior.
  - Introduce changes in file association settings within the container environment and monitor the impact on host-level security controls.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all containers are monitored consistently, which may not be true for all environments.
- May miss detection if adversaries use advanced obfuscation techniques to disguise their activities.
- Relies heavily on the accuracy of log data and network traffic analysis tools.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software updates or installations that change file associations as part of normal operations.
- Misconfigurations in container setups leading to unintended changes in default settings.
  
## Priority
**High**: The use of containers for malicious purposes is a sophisticated technique that can significantly undermine security monitoring systems, providing adversaries with persistence and elevated privileges.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-step Instructions:
1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Deploy a Windows-based container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes).
   - Configure a test container within this environment.

2. **Emulate Adversarial Activity:**
   - Access the test container and use PowerShell to change file associations:
     ```powershell
     assoc .exe=maliciousApp
     ```
   - Modify registry settings to simulate persistence mechanisms.

3. **Monitor and Observe:**
   - Use log aggregation tools to capture changes in file associations.
   - Analyze network traffic for anomalies related to container activities.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. Immediately isolate the affected container from the network to prevent further potential misuse.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation of the container's configuration and logs to determine the scope of the change.
3. Revert any unauthorized changes to file associations or registry settings.
4. Update security policies to mitigate similar future attempts.
