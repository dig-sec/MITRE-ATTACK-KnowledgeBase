# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Exfiltration Over Bluetooth

## Goal
The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exfiltrating sensitive data over Bluetooth connections.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1011.001 - Exfiltration Over Bluetooth
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Exfiltration
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

For more details on this technique, see the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1011/001).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of endpoint telemetry data and network monitoring to identify Bluetooth-based data exfiltration activities. The primary data sources include:
- Endpoint logs for Bluetooth device connections.
- Network traffic analysis for unusual Bluetooth communication patterns.

Patterns analyzed involve detecting unexpected or unauthorized Bluetooth devices pairing with the system, followed by large volumes of outgoing data transfers. Anomalies such as high frequency of Bluetooth communications during off-hours are also scrutinized.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit Bluetooth to exfiltrate data from an organization's network, particularly when traditional network egress points are monitored or restricted. This technique is often used in environments where physical access can be gained without detection, allowing the adversary to pair a device and transfer data covertly.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries might use commands such as:
- On Linux/macOS: `hcitool`, `bluetoothctl` for connecting and sending data.
- On Windows: `BluetoothSendFile.exe` or similar utilities.

Test scenarios could involve setting up a Bluetooth-capable adversary machine to connect with an internal host and simulate file transfer operations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
Known limitations include:
- Difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate use of Bluetooth for business purposes (e.g., IoT devices) versus malicious activity.
- Inability to monitor encrypted Bluetooth traffic without decrypting, which might be impractical or violate privacy regulations.
- Dependence on the presence of endpoint agents capable of capturing relevant telemetry.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Authorized use of Bluetooth for transferring small files during routine operations.
- Temporary connections from known and trusted devices that are not malicious.
- Use of Bluetooth peripherals like keyboards or mice in a corporate setting.

## Priority
**Priority: Medium**

Justification: While the technique is sophisticated enough to evade traditional network-based detection, its effectiveness depends on physical proximity. Therefore, while significant, it is less likely than other methods unless paired with insider threats or physical access breaches.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no standardized adversary emulation instructions are available for this technique in a controlled environment. Future work could involve developing scripts and tools to simulate Bluetooth-based exfiltration activities safely within an isolated test network.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential Bluetooth-based data exfiltration:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Verify the legitimacy of the Bluetooth device connection using endpoint logs.
2. **Data Analysis:** Examine the nature and volume of transferred data for sensitive information.
3. **Containment:** Temporarily disable Bluetooth functionality on affected systems to halt further unauthorized transfers.
4. **Remediation:** Revoke access permissions for any unauthorized devices and update security policies as needed.
5. **Notification:** Inform relevant stakeholders about the incident, especially if sensitive data was compromised.

## Additional Resources
- Further research into MITRE ATT&CK framework regarding Bluetooth vulnerabilities and mitigations.
- Exploration of advanced endpoint detection tools capable of monitoring Bluetooth activity more effectively.
