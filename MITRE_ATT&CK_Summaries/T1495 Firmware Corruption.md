# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Firmware Corruption Detection

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to corrupt firmware on devices running Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. By identifying such activities, organizations can prevent adversaries from maintaining persistent control over compromised systems through corrupted firmware.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1495 - Firmware Corruption
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Impact
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages a combination of endpoint and network data sources to identify patterns indicative of firmware corruption activities. The primary data sources include:

1. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Monitors for unusual system-level operations that might suggest attempts at accessing or altering firmware.
2. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Analyzes logs from various devices for anomalies in firmware update processes, such as unauthorized changes to firmware images or suspicious network traffic patterns associated with firmware updates.
3. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Detects irregular outbound communications that could indicate firmware exfiltration attempts.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unauthorized execution of commands related to firmware access (e.g., `fwupd`, `efibootmgr`).
- Unusual system reboots or interruptions at critical update times, indicating potential firmware tampering.
- Anomalous changes in firmware version data and integrity checks failing unexpectedly.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may attempt firmware corruption by gaining elevated privileges on a compromised device and using legitimate system tools to alter the firmware. This could involve:
- Using command-line utilities designed for firmware updates (e.g., `fwupdmgr` on Linux) in unauthorized ways.
- Modifying BIOS/UEFI settings or bootloaders to load malicious code at startup.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in the firmware update process, such as buffer overflows or insecure transport mechanisms.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Sample commands that might be used for adversary emulation include:
```bash
# On Linux using fwupdmgr (a common tool for managing firmware updates)
fwupdmgr refresh
fwupdmgr get-devices

# For testing suspicious command execution on Windows
bcdedit /enum firmware
```
**Test Scenario:** Simulate an unauthorized attempt to update or modify the BIOS/UEFI settings by executing commands with elevated privileges without proper authorization.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot 1:** Detection might not cover all proprietary systems where custom tools are used for firmware management.
- **Assumption 1:** Assumes that legitimate firmware updates follow a known pattern, which may vary across different vendors and environments.
- **Assumption 2:** Relies on the integrity of logs from EDR and SIEM solutions to provide accurate data for analysis.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate system administrators performing firmware updates as part of regular maintenance.
- Automated update processes initiated by vendor software without malicious intent.
- Normal network traffic patterns associated with authorized firmware upgrade procedures.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Firmware corruption can lead to significant and persistent impacts on affected systems, enabling adversaries to maintain long-term access. It allows attackers to bypass traditional security measures such as antivirus solutions and full-disk encryption by manipulating the boot process at a fundamental level.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential firmware corruption fires:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine the affected device from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigate Logs:** Review logs from EDR, SIEM, and network traffic analysis tools for additional evidence of unauthorized access or tampering.
3. **Verify Firmware Integrity:** Use trusted hashes and checksums provided by vendors to verify the integrity of current firmware images.
4. **Incident Escalation:** Notify security operations teams and relevant stakeholders about potential breaches involving firmware corruption.
