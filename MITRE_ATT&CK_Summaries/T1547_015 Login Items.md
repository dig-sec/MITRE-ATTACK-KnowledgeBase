# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to establish persistence on macOS systems by exploiting login items, which can be used for various malicious activities including privilege escalation.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1547.015 - Login Items
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** macOS  
[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/015)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages event logs and system configuration files to identify unauthorized modifications to login items. By analyzing patterns such as unexpected changes in `/Library/LaunchAgents`, `/LaunchDaemons`, or `~/Library/LaunchAgents` directories, the system can detect potentially malicious scripts or applications set to launch at startup.

Data sources include:
- System integrity protection logs
- Launch services database (`/System/Library/LaunchServices/com.apple.launchd.plist`)
- User-specific login items

Patterns analyzed:
- Unexpected creation or modification of files in startup directories
- Use of non-standard scripts or binaries in login items
- Changes to user profiles or system settings associated with these directories

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use macOS's built-in capabilities for persistence by adding malicious applications or scripts to the list of login items. This can be achieved via:
- Application bundle manipulations (e.g., using `defaults write` commands)
- AppleScript for automating changes in user settings
- Modifying plist files associated with Launch Agents

Real-world execution might involve an adversary embedding a payload within a legitimate-looking application or script that gets executed upon login.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Sample command to add a malicious item:
```bash
echo 'tell application "System Events" to make new login item at end with properties {path:"/usr/bin/suspicious_script.sh", hidden:false}'
osascript -e '
tell app "System Events"
    set myLoginItem to make new login item with properties {path: "/usr/bin/malicious_app"}
end tell'
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection might miss scripts added through other means, such as manual user consent or sophisticated evasion techniques.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that changes to login items are a sign of malicious activity, which may not always be the case with legitimate software updates.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate applications updating their settings and adding themselves to startup items (e.g., backup software or VPN clients)
- User-initiated modifications for convenience or personal scripts

## Priority
**High.** macOS is widely used in enterprise environments, making it a valuable target for attackers seeking persistence. The ability of adversaries to exploit login items can lead to long-term access and privilege escalation.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Execute the following command to modify the terminal profile:
   ```powershell
   Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Terminal" -Name DefaultProfile -Value "{GUID}"
   ```
3. Replace `{GUID}` with a custom identifier for your malicious application.

### Add macOS LoginItem using AppleScript
1. Open Terminal.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   echo 'tell application "System Events" to make new login item at end with properties {path:"/usr/bin/malicious_script.sh", hidden:false}' | osascript -
   ```
3. Verify by checking `/Library/LaunchAgents`, `/LaunchDaemons`, or `~/Library/LaunchAgents` for any newly added items.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
- Immediately investigate the affected system for signs of compromise.
- Review logs to determine the origin and scope of the changes.
- Remove unauthorized login items from startup directories.
- Update firewall rules and endpoint protection settings as necessary.
- Consider conducting a full security audit on the compromised machine.
