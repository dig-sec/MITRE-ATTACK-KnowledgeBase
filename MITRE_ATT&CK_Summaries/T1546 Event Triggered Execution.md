# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## **Goal**
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies. This includes identifying malicious activities within containers that might be overlooked due to the isolation and abstraction layers provided by such environments.

## **Categorization**

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1546 - Event Triggered Execution
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Persistence
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)

## **Strategy Abstract**
The detection strategy involves monitoring container activities and analyzing patterns indicative of adversarial behavior. Key data sources include:

- Container runtime logs (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Host system logs
- Network traffic analysis

Patterns to analyze:
- Unusual process executions within containers
- Anomalous network connections from/to the host or external IPs
- Unexpected changes in container configurations or images
- Suspicious file operations related to persistence mechanisms

## **Technical Context**
Adversaries may use containers to execute malicious payloads while evading traditional security controls. Common methods include:

- Launching persistent backdoors within containers.
- Exploiting container orchestration tools for lateral movement.
- Using container images as a vector for malware distribution.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Example commands and scenarios:
- **Docker Commands:** `docker run --rm -it <image> /bin/bash` to execute code in isolated environments.
- **Kubernetes Jobs:** Creating pods with malicious scripts or binaries.
- **Volume Mounts:** Abusing shared volumes for data exfiltration.

## **Blind Spots and Assumptions**
Known limitations:
- Insufficient visibility into multi-layered container stacks.
- Over-reliance on signature-based detection might miss novel threats.
- Difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate automation processes and malicious activities.

Assumptions:
- The underlying host system is secure and monitored effectively.
- Container runtime environments are configured with security best practices.

## **False Positives**
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate software updates or patches running inside containers.
- Routine maintenance tasks using containerized applications.
- Development environment setups where temporary container configurations might mimic malicious patterns.

## **Priority**
Severity: High

Justification:
The ability to bypass security monitoring through containers presents a significant threat, as it can lead to persistent access and lateral movement within an organization’s network. Given the increasing adoption of containerization technologies, addressing these threats is critical for maintaining robust security postures.

## **Validation (Adversary Emulation)**

### Persistence Techniques:
1. **Custom AutodialDLL:**
   - Execute a DLL that triggers on specific events to maintain persistence.
   
2. **CommandProcessor AutoRun Key:**
   - **HKLM (With Elevation):** Modify `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` with `AutoRun` entry for system-wide execution.
   - **HKCU (Without Elevation):** Modify `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` similarly, affecting only the current user.

3. **WMI Invoke-CimMethod:**
   - Use `Invoke-CimMethod StartProcess` to initiate processes invisibly through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

4. **Custom Debugger for Error Reporting:**
   - Configure a custom debugger in Windows Error Reporting to intercept and handle errors, potentially executing malicious code.

5. **DLL Loading on RDP Execution:**
   - Load a custom DLL when initiating an RDP session with `mstsc.exe` using registry-based or startup-script methods.

6. **ErrorHandler.cmd Script:**
   - Utilize scripts like `ErrorHandler.cmd` to execute persistence commands upon encountering errors in other processes.

7. **MS-WORD STARTUP-PATH:**
   - Leverage MS-Word’s VBA capabilities by setting a startup path that executes malicious code when the application is launched.

## **Response**

When an alert fires:
1. Isolate the affected container and host system to prevent further spread.
2. Perform a detailed forensic analysis of container logs, network traffic, and file changes.
3. Review recent changes in container configurations or images for unauthorized modifications.
4. Update security policies and controls based on findings to mitigate similar threats.

## **Additional Resources**

For more context and references:
- Investigate activities involving suspicious copying from/to system directories as they might indicate attempts at data exfiltration or persistence.
- Utilize threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about new container-related attack vectors and mitigation strategies.
