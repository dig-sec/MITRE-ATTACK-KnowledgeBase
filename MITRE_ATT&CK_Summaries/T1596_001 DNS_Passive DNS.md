# Alerting & Detection Strategy Report: DNS/Passive DNS Reconnaissance Techniques

## Goal

The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts that exploit DNS and passive DNS techniques for reconnaissance purposes. These activities often involve adversaries querying DNS records to gather information about a network's structure, services, or potential targets.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1596.001 - DNS/Passive DNS
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Preparation)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596/001)

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages various data sources, including DNS query logs and passive DNS records, to detect unusual or malicious patterns indicative of reconnaissance activities. Key indicators include:

1. **Anomalous Query Patterns:** Detection of high volumes of DNS queries in a short period, especially targeting uncommonly queried domains.
2. **Known Malicious Domains:** Queries for domains associated with malicious activity or blacklisted entities.
3. **Unusual Top-Level Domains (TLDs):** Frequent queries to newly registered or unusual TLDs that deviate from normal organizational traffic.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use DNS as a tool for reconnaissance by querying internal and external DNS records. This can reveal valuable information about the network's topology, active services, and potentially vulnerable targets. Common adversary techniques include:

- **Enumeration of Internal Hostnames:** Querying known internal DNS names to map out organizational resources.
- **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA):** Using DGAs to generate domains that are then queried for malicious intent or communication with command-and-control servers.

### Adversary Emulation Details

To emulate this technique, an adversary might use commands such as:

```bash
nslookup -query=any targetdomain.com
dig A targetdomain.com +trace
```

These commands simulate DNS queries to gather information about a target domain's network structure and associated records.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Encrypted Traffic:** Detection may be limited if DNS traffic is encrypted (e.g., via DNS over HTTPS).
- **Dynamic IP Assignments:** Frequent changes in internal IP assignments can lead to benign anomalies that mimic malicious activity.
- **Legitimate High Volume Queries:** Certain business processes might generate high volumes of legitimate DNS queries, complicating detection.

## False Positives

Potential sources of false positives include:

- Legitimate network scanning or diagnostic tools that query a wide range of domains.
- Development environments where frequent changes to domain configurations are common.
- Routine maintenance activities involving DNS record updates.

## Priority

**Priority: High**

The high priority is justified by the critical role DNS plays in network reconnaissance. Early detection can prevent adversaries from gaining insights into network vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors, thereby reducing overall risk.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available for adversary emulation within a controlled test environment. Future efforts should focus on developing safe, isolated scenarios to validate the effectiveness of this strategy.

## Response

When an alert is triggered:

1. **Investigate the Source:** Determine if the query originated from a legitimate source or an untrusted device.
2. **Analyze Query Patterns:** Examine the frequency and targets of DNS queries for signs of malicious intent.
3. **Correlate with Other Indicators:** Cross-reference with other security alerts or logs to identify broader attack patterns.
4. **Contain and Mitigate:** If malicious activity is confirmed, isolate affected systems and apply necessary patches or configurations.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional references or context are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework and general best practices for DNS monitoring and analysis. Future enhancements should include case studies or real-world examples of successful detections using this strategy.
