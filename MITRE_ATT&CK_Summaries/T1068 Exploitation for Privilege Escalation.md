# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by utilizing containerization technology. These adversaries exploit containers to obscure malicious activities, thereby evading detection from traditional security tools.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1068 - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows, Containers

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing container orchestration environments to identify suspicious activities that may indicate an attempt to bypass security controls. Key data sources include:

- **Container Logs:** Analyzing logs for unusual or unauthorized access patterns.
- **Network Traffic:** Monitoring network traffic for anomalies associated with container communications.
- **File System Activity:** Observing changes in the file system related to container configurations and runtime.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unexpected increases in resource usage (CPU, memory).
- Unauthorized creation of new containers.
- Alterations to existing security policies or rules within the orchestration platform.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers by leveraging their isolation capabilities to hide malicious processes. They may use known vulnerabilities in container management software to gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges. Common tactics include:

- **Container Escape:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to break out of a container.
- **Resource Misuse:** Using container resources for command-and-control operations or data exfiltration.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries might execute commands such as:
```bash
docker run --privileged -it <malicious_image>
```
This command runs a Docker container with elevated privileges, potentially allowing further exploitation of the host system.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into encrypted container communications can obscure malicious activities.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that monitoring systems have full access to all relevant data sources within the container environment.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks involving container management.
- Normal spikes in resource usage during peak operational hours.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability of adversaries to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant risk, as it allows them to operate undetected within an environment. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and further exploitation of system vulnerabilities.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
No specific emulation instructions are available for this technique. However, setting up a controlled test environment with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm can help in validating detection mechanisms.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analyze the context of the alert to determine if it indicates malicious activity.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers and hosts to prevent further spread.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that were exploited.
4. **Remediation:** Patch identified vulnerabilities and update security policies.

## Additional Resources
No additional resources are currently available for this technique. However, staying informed about the latest container security best practices and threat intelligence is recommended.
