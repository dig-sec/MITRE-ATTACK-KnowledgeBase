# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detecting Adversarial Use of Netsh Helper DLL for Privilege Escalation and Persistence on Windows

## Goal

The goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to exploit the `Netsh` command-line tool with a malicious helper Dynamic Link Library (DLL) in order to achieve privilege escalation or persistence on Windows systems.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages monitoring of system command-line activities, specifically focusing on the `Netsh` tool usage with suspicious DLLs. By examining event logs and process execution histories, this strategy aims to detect anomalous patterns indicative of exploitation:

- **Data Sources:**
  - Windows Event Logs (e.g., Security, System)
  - Process Monitoring Tools
  - File Integrity Monitoring

- **Patterns Analyzed:**
  - Invocation of `Netsh` with unexpected or unauthorized DLLs.
  - Unusual `Netsh` command-line arguments that suggest manipulation for privilege escalation.
  - Sudden appearance of DLL files in system directories typically not associated with legitimate operations.

## Technical Context

Adversaries use the `Netsh` tool, a command-line utility provided by Windows to configure network interfaces, to load and execute malicious helper DLLs. This technique is often used post-compromise to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. The exploitation involves:

- Registering a malicious DLL using `Netsh add helper`.
- Executing commands through `Netsh` that invoke the malicious functionality of the helper DLL.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- Sample Command:
  ```shell
  netsh add helper C:\Windows\System32\example.dll
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Assumptions:** 
  - Detection assumes familiarity with typical legitimate use cases of `Netsh` on the monitored network.
  
- **Limitations:**
  - False negatives could occur if attackers obfuscate or modify DLLs to evade detection patterns.
  - Limited visibility into encrypted or hidden command-line activities.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate administrative use of `Netsh` for network troubleshooting or configuration.
- Use of custom helper DLLs by software developers in non-malicious testing environments.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

Justification:
- The technique can significantly elevate an adversary's privileges, leading to greater control over the compromised system and potentially impacting broader network security.
- Given its stealthy nature and potential for persistence, timely detection is critical.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

To validate this strategy in a controlled environment:

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Ensure a non-production Windows machine or isolated virtual environment.

2. **Register Netsh Helper DLL:**
   ```shell
   netsh add helper C:\Windows\System32\test-helper.dll
   ```
   - Create `test-helper.dll` to simulate malicious activity (e.g., log execution).

3. **Execute Test Commands:**
   - Use the registered helper with a `Netsh` command:
     ```shell
     netsh help show
     ```

4. **Monitor Alerts:**
   - Check for generated alerts based on predefined detection patterns.

## Response

When an alert is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Confirm and Assess:** Verify if the usage of `Netsh` with a helper DLL aligns with known legitimate activities.
2. **Investigate Further:**
   - Examine related logs to identify any preceding suspicious activities.
   - Analyze the contents and behavior of the registered DLL.

3. **Containment Actions:**
   - Immediately remove or disable the malicious `Netsh` configuration if confirmed as a threat.
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent lateral movement.

4. **Remediation:** 
   - Patch vulnerabilities allowing such exploitation.
   - Update security policies and detection signatures based on findings.
