# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this detection technique is to identify adversarial attempts to exploit services file permission weaknesses on Windows platforms. These adversaries aim to bypass security monitoring systems by manipulating permissions in ways that could lead to persistence, privilege escalation, or defense evasion.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1574.010 - Services File Permissions Weakness
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:**
  - Persistence
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy leverages various data sources such as system logs, event logs, and file integrity monitoring to identify patterns indicative of compromised service permissions. By continuously analyzing these data streams, the strategy focuses on detecting unauthorized changes or configurations in service files that could signal adversarial activities.

### Data Sources:
- **Windows Event Logs:** Monitor for anomalies in services start-up events.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Track unauthorized modifications to critical service configuration files.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:** Correlate logs from multiple sources to identify suspicious activities involving service permissions.

### Patterns Analyzed:
- Unusual changes in file permissions of system services.
- Unexpected modifications to the `services.exe.config` or similar configuration files.
- Anomalies indicating unauthorized privilege escalation attempts via service configurations.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit weaknesses in Windows Service File Permissions by altering access rights, enabling unauthorized users to start services with elevated privileges. These changes often occur under the radar of traditional security monitoring tools.

### Adversary Execution:
1. **Initial Access:** Gain initial foothold on a target system.
2. **Privilege Escalation:** Modify service permissions to escalate privileges.
3. **Persistence and Defense Evasion:** Use modified services for maintaining persistence and evading detection.

#### Sample Commands:
- `sc config serviceName binPath= "C:\path\to\malicious.exe" obj= "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"`
- `icacls C:\Windows\System32\services.exe /grant Everyone:F`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Limited visibility into encrypted or obfuscated command executions may hinder detection.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes that all critical services and their configuration files are known and monitored. Changes in service configurations not covered by FIM might be missed.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative changes to service permissions or configurations.
- Software installations or updates altering system files, including those related to services.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

### Justification:
The technique poses a significant risk as it allows adversaries to maintain access and escalate privileges on compromised systems. The ability to evade detection by modifying service file permissions can lead to prolonged unauthorized access and control over critical resources.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are not available due to the potential risks associated with conducting live tests involving privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms.

## Response
When an alert triggers, analysts should:
1. **Verify Alert Validity:** Confirm if unauthorized changes have occurred by cross-referencing with change management logs.
2. **Investigate Source:** Determine how changes were made and identify any signs of compromise or lateral movement within the network.
3. **Containment:** Immediately revoke unauthorized permissions and restart affected services in a secure state.
4. **Eradication:** Remove any malicious components introduced through compromised services.
5. **Recovery:** Restore service configurations to their intended states from verified backups.
