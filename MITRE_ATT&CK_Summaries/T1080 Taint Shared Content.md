# Detection Strategy Report: Detecting Adversarial Use of Containers to Bypass Security Monitoring

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to use containers as a means to bypass security monitoring and controls within an organization's network infrastructure.

## Strategy Abstract

This detection strategy leverages a multi-source approach to identify suspicious container activities that may indicate adversarial use. The following data sources are used:

- **Container Orchestration Logs:** Analyze Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and OpenShift logs for unusual patterns in container deployments.
- **Network Traffic Data:** Monitor ingress and egress traffic related to containers for abnormal communication paths or unexpected destinations.
- **System Event Logs:** Examine host system event logs for unauthorized changes in service configurations that might facilitate container use.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual spikes in container creation or deletion.
- Unexpected access patterns between containers and network resources.
- Containers communicating with external IP addresses associated with known malicious entities.

## Technical Context

Adversaries may exploit containers to evade traditional security controls due to their inherent flexibility and the isolated environments they provide. This can be executed through:

- **Deployment of Malicious Containers:** Adversaries might deploy a container that runs unauthorized code or processes without being detected by conventional antivirus solutions.
- **Container Escape Techniques:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in containerization platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) to gain access to the host system and circumvent network segmentation.

Adversary emulation scenarios may include commands such as:

```bash
docker run -d --name malicious_container my_malicious_image
kubectl create deployment --image=malicious_image my-deployment
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spot:** Detection strategy might not identify new, unknown malicious container images that bypass existing signature-based detection mechanisms.
- **Assumption:** The organization has a baseline of normal behavior for containers, which allows deviation analysis to detect anomalies effectively.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate deployments of new services using containers as part of standard development and operations processes.
- Automated scripts or CI/CD pipelines that create, modify, or delete containers during routine maintenance.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

This technique is prioritized highly due to the increasing adoption of container technology in enterprise environments. The potential for adversaries to exploit these technologies for lateral movement and evasion poses a significant risk if not adequately monitored and controlled.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment are currently unavailable. Organizations should develop custom adversary emulation scenarios tailored to their specific infrastructure and security posture.

## Response
When an alert related to suspicious container activity is triggered, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm that the detected activity deviates significantly from established baselines.
2. **Containment:** Temporarily halt any suspicious container operations if feasible without disrupting legitimate services.
3. **Investigation:** Analyze the affected containers and network traffic to determine the scope and intent of the activity.
4. **Remediation:** Remove or isolate malicious containers, patch vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries, and strengthen security controls.
5. **Communication:** Inform relevant stakeholders and update incident response plans based on findings.
