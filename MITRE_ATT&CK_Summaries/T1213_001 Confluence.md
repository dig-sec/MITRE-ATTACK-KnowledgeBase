# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework Report

## Goal
The aim of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers. This involves identifying instances where adversaries leverage containerized environments to evade detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container usage patterns and anomalies that may indicate adversarial activities. Data sources such as logs from container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), network traffic, and system-level events are analyzed to identify suspicious behaviors like unauthorized access attempts or abnormal resource consumption. Patterns of interest include unexpected communication between containers, unusual API requests, and deviations from normal execution paths.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use containers as a means to obfuscate their activities and maintain persistence within an environment. Techniques may involve deploying malicious applications within containers that are designed to blend in with legitimate workloads. In real-world scenarios, attackers might utilize popular container management tools or platforms like Docker to launch these operations.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries could execute commands such as:
- `docker run -d --name malicious_container <malicious_image>`
- Setting up reverse shells within containers for persistent access

Test scenarios may include creating a benign but anomalous container environment and monitoring how the system reacts to it.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** Detection strategies might not fully capture zero-day exploits or entirely new methods of using containers maliciously.
- **Assumption:** It is assumed that normal operations within a containerized environment can be sufficiently profiled, which may not hold true in highly dynamic settings.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use cases where containers communicate with external services for development or testing purposes.
- Regular updates and maintenance activities that might momentarily resemble adversarial behaviors.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

The severity is rated high due to the increasing prevalence of container usage in enterprise environments, which provides adversaries with more opportunities to exploit these systems. The potential impact of undetected malicious activity within containers can be significant, affecting data integrity and confidentiality.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no detailed step-by-step instructions for emulating this technique in a test environment are available. Future efforts should focus on developing comprehensive emulation scenarios that safely replicate adversarial behaviors without risking actual system compromise.

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Verify the Alert:** Confirm whether the activity aligns with known benign patterns or genuine threats.
2. **Containment:** Isolate suspicious containers to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized access.
3. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough analysis of container logs, network traffic, and system events associated with the alert.
4. **Remediation:** Implement necessary patches or changes to security configurations to close vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.

## Additional Resources
No additional resources are currently available for this specific detection strategy. Future efforts should involve gathering more context from industry best practices and threat intelligence sources related to container security.
