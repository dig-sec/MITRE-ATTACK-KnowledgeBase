# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using `Regsvr32`

## Goal
This strategy aims to detect adversarial attempts that exploit the `regsvr32` utility on Windows systems to bypass security monitoring mechanisms. This involves registering and executing DLLs in ways that may avoid detection by traditional security tools.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages data from multiple sources such as process monitoring, file integrity checks, and network traffic analysis. It focuses on identifying unusual patterns of `regsvr32` usage, which might indicate malicious activity:

- **Data Sources:**
  - Process Monitoring: Tracking execution of the `regsvr32.exe`.
  - File Integrity: Checking for unexpected DLL registration or modification.
  - Network Traffic: Analyzing network connections initiated by processes executing `regsvr32`.

- **Patterns Analyzed:**
  - Execution from unusual locations
  - Use of uncommon file extensions with `regsvr32`
  - Silent execution flags that might suggest evasion attempts

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use the `regsvr32` utility to execute malicious DLLs by leveraging its ability to register or unregister COM components. This technique can be used in various forms:

- **Local COM Scriptlet Execution:** Running scripts directly from memory.
- **Remote COM Scriptlet Execution:** Executing a script located on a remote server.
- **Local DLL Execution:** Registering and executing a local DLL file using `regsvr32`.
- **Non-DLL Registration:** Using the utility to perform tasks beyond typical DLL registration.

Adversaries can employ these methods to achieve persistence, lateral movement, or execute malicious payloads while avoiding detection by standard monitoring tools.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - The strategy may not detect advanced techniques where adversaries obfuscate the `regsvr32` process.
  - Encrypted network traffic initiated post-execution might evade detection.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that all uses of `regsvr32` for DLL execution are suspicious in certain contexts (e.g., non-standard usage patterns).
  - Depends on the accuracy and timeliness of data from monitoring tools.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of `regsvr32` by system administrators to deploy updates or configure services.
- Use of the utility in development environments where unusual file extensions may be common.
- Scheduled tasks executing `regsvr32` for maintenance purposes.

## Priority
**Priority Level: High**

Justification: The ability to execute and register DLLs using `regsvr32` without detection poses a significant threat, as it can lead to persistence and lateral movement within the network. Early detection is critical in mitigating potential breaches.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Test Scenarios

1. **Regsvr32 Local COM Scriptlet Execution:**
   - Use PowerShell or another scripting language to create a COM object script.
   - Execute using `regsvr32`.

2. **Regsvr32 Remote COM Scriptlet Execution:**
   - Host the script on a remote server and use network shares or web services to access it.
   - Run `regsvr32` with a URL pointing to the script.

3. **Regsvr32 Local DLL Execution:**
   - Create a benign DLL file for testing.
   - Use `regsvr32 /u /s <DLLName>` to unregister and `/s <DLLName>` to register it silently.

4. **Regsvr32 Registering Non-DLL:**
   - Attempt registering a non-standard file type (e.g., `.txt`) with `regsvr32`.

5. **Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer:**
   - Create a custom DLL that calls `DllRegisterServer`.
   - Use `regsvr32 /s <DLLName>` to execute silently.

## Response

When an alert for suspicious `regsvr32` activity is triggered:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Log Analysis:** Review process execution logs, file integrity reports, and network traffic details related to the `regsvr32` event.
3. **Threat Hunting:** Investigate any associated processes or files that might indicate further malicious activity.
4. **Incident Response Plan:** Follow organizational incident response protocols for potential compromise.
