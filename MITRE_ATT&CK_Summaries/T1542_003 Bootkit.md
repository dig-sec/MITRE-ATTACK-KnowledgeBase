# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Bootkit Techniques

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to deploy bootkits on both Linux and Windows platforms. Bootkits are a type of malware that infect the Master Boot Record (MBR) or Volume Boot Sector, allowing adversaries to maintain persistence and evade traditional security defenses by loading their malicious code before the operating system.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1542.003 - Bootkit
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows

For more details on this technique, refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/003).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of log analysis and behavioral monitoring to identify anomalies indicative of bootkit deployment. Key data sources include:
- **Boot Logs:** Analyze logs from system boot processes to detect unauthorized changes or unexpected activities in the MBR or Volume Boot Sector.
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Monitor changes to critical system files associated with boot operations, such as `bootmgr` on Windows and GRUB configuration on Linux.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identify unusual network traffic patterns that may correspond with remote loading of bootkit components.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unauthorized modifications to the MBR or Volume Boot Sector.
- Unusual changes in system files responsible for boot operations.
- Unexpected network communications during boot-up sequences.

## Technical Context
Bootkits operate by replacing or altering low-level code executed at system startup. Adversaries execute these attacks using sophisticated tools that can modify firmware or bootloader components to load malicious payloads before the OS boots, thereby avoiding detection by traditional security mechanisms.

In practice, adversaries may use tools like `mbrcheck` on Windows or modify GRUB configurations on Linux systems. They might also employ techniques such as UEFI rootkits to gain deeper control over boot processes.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may be limited if the adversary successfully masks changes within legitimate-looking boot sequences.
- **Assumptions:** The strategy assumes that any unauthorized modification or anomaly in boot-related files is indicative of malicious activity, which may not always hold true for all benign scenarios.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate updates to bootloader configurations or firmware by system administrators.
- Changes due to legitimate recovery operations or software installations involving bootloader components.

## Priority
The priority for detecting bootkit techniques is **High**. This is justified by the severe impact of such attacks, which can lead to persistent access and evasion of security controls, making systems highly vulnerable to further exploitation.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no publicly available detailed emulation instructions for this technique due to its complexity and the potential risks involved in deploying malicious bootkits. Organizations are encouraged to collaborate with cybersecurity experts or use controlled environments to safely test detection capabilities.

## Response
When an alert indicating a potential bootkit deployment is triggered:
1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread of the threat.
2. **Conduct Forensic Analysis:** Analyze logs and changes to MBR/VBS, bootloader configurations, and network traffic for signs of malicious activity.
3. **Initiate Recovery Procedures:** Restore system integrity using known-good backups and verified clean versions of boot files.
4. **Enhance Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on similar systems within the environment to detect any further attempts.

## Additional Resources
Currently, there are no additional resources available specifically for this detection strategy. Organizations should refer to general guidelines on bootloader security and firmware protection provided by reputable cybersecurity bodies.
