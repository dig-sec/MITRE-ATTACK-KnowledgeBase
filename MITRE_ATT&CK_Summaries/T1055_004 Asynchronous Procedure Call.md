# Palantir Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using asynchronous procedure calls (APCs). Specifically, it targets scenarios where attackers use APCs for process injection and privilege escalation on Windows systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1055.004 - Asynchronous Procedure Call
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:**
  - Defense Evasion
  - Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages system logs, process monitoring tools, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to identify suspicious APC activities. It analyzes patterns such as unexpected APC calls in benign processes, irregular inter-process communication (IPC), and unusual memory access behaviors that indicate potential abuse of the APC mechanism for malicious purposes.

Data sources include:
- Windows Event Logs
- Process execution logs
- Memory dumps
- Network traffic logs

The strategy focuses on detecting anomalies like unauthorized process injections or privilege escalations through APCs by correlating these data points with known adversary tactics and techniques.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit APCs to inject malicious code into legitimate processes, thereby evading detection. They may use tools like early birds (ETW/WinEvents) to schedule APCs for later execution when they believe the system is less monitored or defenses are lowered.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Using C# for process injection via APC
  - Go language scripts for EarlyBird APC Queue Injection and Remote Process Injection with NtQueueApcThreadEx

### Test Scenarios:
1. Inject a benign payload into a critical system process using a crafted APC.
2. Schedule an APC in a low-privileged user account to escalate privileges.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that all APC activities are logged accurately by the EDR solution.
- May miss sophisticated evasion techniques where adversaries mask their actions as legitimate APC usage.
- Limited effectiveness on systems with restricted logging or monitoring capabilities.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of APCs for inter-process communication in trusted applications.
- Scheduled tasks or system services using APCs for routine operations.
- Network management tools that employ APCs for performance optimization.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The technique is associated with defense evasion and privilege escalation, making it a critical threat vector. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the targeted environment, allowing attackers to operate undetected while accessing sensitive data or systems.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To validate detection capabilities, follow these steps in a controlled test environment:

1. **Process Injection via C#:**
   - Develop a C# application that uses APCs to inject code into a target process.
   - Execute the application and monitor system logs for unauthorized injections.

2. **EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go:**
   - Implement an EarlyBird script using Go to schedule an APC for later execution.
   - Analyze EDR alerts triggered by this activity.

3. **Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI:**
   - Create a Go program that leverages the `NtQueueApcThreadEx` API to inject code remotely into another process.
   - Validate detection by reviewing alerts generated during the test.

## Response
When an alert related to this technique fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Source:** Confirm if the APC activity originates from a known or trusted application.
2. **Assess Impact:** Determine the affected processes and potential impact on system integrity.
3. **Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread of malicious activities.
4. **Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation using forensic tools to understand the scope and origin of the attack.
5. **Remediation:** Remove any injected payloads and restore affected systems to their normal state.
