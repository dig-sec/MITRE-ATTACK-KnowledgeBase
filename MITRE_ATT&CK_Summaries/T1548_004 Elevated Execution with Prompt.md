# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers on macOS systems.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1548.004 - Elevated Execution with Prompt  
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion  
- **Platforms:** macOS  
  [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/004)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages various data sources including system logs, process monitoring tools, and container orchestration logs to identify suspicious activities related to the use of containers for elevated execution. The focus is on pattern analysis that highlights anomalous behavior such as unauthorized access to privileged operations or unexpected elevation attempts within container environments.

## Technical Context
Adversaries execute this technique by exploiting vulnerabilities in container management systems to gain elevated privileges, often bypassing standard security controls. Real-world instances involve adversaries injecting malicious payloads into containers to execute commands with higher privileges than intended. Typical adversary actions include leveraging misconfigured container permissions or using known vulnerabilities in the container orchestration platform.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- Sample Commands:
  - Use of `docker exec` to run processes as root inside a compromised container.
  - Manipulating Kubernetes role-based access controls (RBAC) for unauthorized privilege escalation.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may miss zero-day vulnerabilities in container management systems.
  - Limited visibility into encrypted or obfuscated network traffic used by adversaries within containers.
  
- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that monitoring tools have access to comprehensive logs from all layers of the container stack.
  - Relies on up-to-date threat intelligence feeds to identify emerging attack vectors.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate administrative tasks performed by IT staff using elevated privileges within containers.
- Automated deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines that temporarily require elevated permissions for setup or maintenance.

## Priority
**High:**  
The severity is high due to the potential for adversaries to gain full control over systems if successful in exploiting container vulnerabilities. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and significant operational disruptions.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
No validated steps are currently available for adversary emulation specific to this technique within a controlled environment. Future validations will involve setting up test scenarios that mimic common adversarial tactics such as misconfigured Docker services or exploiting known Kubernetes vulnerabilities.

## Response
When an alert related to this technique fires, analysts should:
1. Immediately isolate the affected container and system from the network.
2. Conduct a thorough investigation of all recent activities within the impacted environment.
3. Review access logs for unauthorized privilege escalations.
4. Patch any identified vulnerabilities in the container orchestration platform or management systems.
5. Update security configurations to prevent similar incidents, including tightening RBAC policies.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Future reports may include more detailed guides and case studies as threat intelligence evolves.
