# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal

The goal of this strategy is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms through the use of containers. Specifically, it aims to identify unauthorized scanning activities targeting databases within containerized environments.

- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Reconnaissance
- **Platforms:** PRE (Pre-Execution)

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources such as container runtime logs, network traffic analysis, and database access logs to identify unauthorized scanning activities. The key patterns analyzed include unusual network connections originating from containers, anomalous database query patterns, and discrepancies between declared and actual container behavior.

1. **Data Sources:**
   - Container Runtime Logs
   - Network Traffic Analysis
   - Database Access Logs

2. **Patterns Analyzed:**
   - Unusual or frequent database scanning attempts originating from a container.
   - Atypical network traffic patterns indicating reconnaissance activities.
   - Anomalies in user behavior concerning database access.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often exploit containers to mask their presence and bypass traditional security monitoring systems. They may deploy malicious containers designed to scan for vulnerabilities within databases, leveraging the ephemeral nature of container environments to evade detection. Such techniques include:

- Launching containers with pre-configured scripts to perform scans.
- Exploiting misconfigurations in network policies allowing containers unrestricted access.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

To emulate this technique:
1. Deploy a benign or test database within an isolated environment.
2. Use a container orchestration platform like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to launch a container with scanning tools (e.g., Nmap, Nikto).
3. Configure the container with network access policies that allow it to attempt scans against the target database.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:** Detection may not cover highly sophisticated attacks using encrypted payloads or leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities within containerized environments.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes baseline knowledge of normal container behavior patterns; deviations are flagged as potential threats. Also assumes that logging mechanisms are fully enabled and correctly configured.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Routine database maintenance tasks involving scanning or querying.
- Legitimate security audits using automated tools for vulnerability assessment.
- Development or testing environments where such activities are expected and frequent.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

**Justification:** The technique targets critical data assets, namely databases, with the potential to cause significant disruption if exploited. Furthermore, bypassing security monitoring can lead to prolonged undetected presence of adversaries within a network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

Currently, no detailed adversary emulation steps are available. However, general guidance involves:

1. Setting up a controlled test environment mimicking production.
2. Deploying benign containerized applications that simulate known scanning tools and techniques.
3. Observing how these activities trigger detection mechanisms and adjusting thresholds accordingly.

## Response

When an alert fires:
- Immediately isolate the suspicious container from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the containerâ€™s logs, network activity, and any related database access events.
- Review and update security policies and configurations to mitigate similar vulnerabilities.
- Document findings and share insights with relevant stakeholders for continuous improvement in detection strategies.

## Additional Resources

Currently, no additional resources are available. However, staying updated with MITRE ATT&CK framework updates and engaging with cybersecurity communities can provide further context and enhance understanding of emerging threats related to containerized environments.
