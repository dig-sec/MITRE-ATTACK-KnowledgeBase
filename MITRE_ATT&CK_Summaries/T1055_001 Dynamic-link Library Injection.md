# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework

## Goal

The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using Dynamic-link Library Injection on Windows platforms. This involves identifying malicious activities where adversaries leverage DLL injection methods to execute unauthorized code, facilitating privilege escalation and evasion from detection mechanisms.

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing process behaviors, memory allocations, and network activity for signs of DLL injection. Key data sources include:

- Process creation logs
- Memory dumps
- Network traffic analysis
- PowerShell script execution patterns

Patterns analyzed include unusual or unauthorized changes to process command lines, the loading of suspicious DLLs into processes, and anomalous network activities associated with known malicious domains or IP addresses.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often use Dynamic-link Library Injection (DLL injection) to execute malicious payloads without being detected by traditional antivirus solutions. This technique involves injecting a DLL into a running process's address space, thereby gaining control over it. In real-world scenarios, adversaries may employ tools like `mavinject.exe` or leverage PowerShell scripts with UsoClient DLL loading techniques for stealthy execution.

### Adversary Emulation Details

- **Sample Commands:**
  - Using `mavinject.exe` to inject a malicious DLL into a legitimate process.
  - Leveraging WinPwn toolkits to gain SYSTEM-level access and bind a system shell using DLL injection.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- The detection strategy assumes that adversaries are attempting to use common Windows processes for DLL injection, potentially missing less conventional methods or custom-built tools.
- Assumes the presence of comprehensive logging and monitoring systems capable of capturing detailed process and memory events.
- Potential blind spots in detecting highly sophisticated evasion techniques that manipulate logs or hide their tracks.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate software development activities involving dynamic linking during testing phases.
- Authorized use of debugging tools by IT personnel which may involve DLL injection for troubleshooting purposes.
- Legitimate processes using third-party plugins or extensions that dynamically load additional libraries.

## Priority

**Severity:** High

Justification: DLL injection is a potent technique used by adversaries to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, and evade detection. The potential impact of such activities on organizational security and integrity warrants high priority for detection and response efforts.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Prepare a controlled test environment with monitoring tools like Sysmon, PowerShell logging enabled, and network traffic capture capabilities.

2. **Process Injection via `mavinject.exe`:**
   - Obtain `mavinject.exe` from a safe source.
   - Identify a legitimate process to target (e.g., `svchost.exe`).
   - Execute the command: `mavinject.exe [Target Process] [DLL Path]`.

3. **WinPwn - Get SYSTEM Shell:**
   - Use WinPwn toolkits in the test environment to gain elevated privileges.
   - Follow the toolkit instructions to achieve a SYSTEM shell.

4. **Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL Load Technique:**
   - Utilize PowerShell scripts that leverage the `UsoClient` technique to load and execute payloads, ensuring logs capture relevant events for analysis.

## Response

When an alert indicating potential DLL injection is triggered:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.
   - Disable or terminate suspicious processes identified by monitoring tools.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze logs and memory dumps for evidence of unauthorized code execution.
   - Determine the origin and purpose of the injected DLL.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove malicious payloads from affected systems.
   - Apply necessary patches or security updates to prevent recurrence.

4. **Notification:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders about the incident and actions taken.

5. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough review to improve detection strategies and response plans.
