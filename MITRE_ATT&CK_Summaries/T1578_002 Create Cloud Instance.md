# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary aim of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging container technologies within cloud environments. This technique focuses on detecting unauthorized creation or manipulation of containers to evade traditional security measures.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1578.002 - Create Cloud Instance
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/002)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy utilizes multiple data sources, including logs from cloud infrastructure management tools (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs), container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes audit logs), and network traffic analysis. Patterns such as unusual creation of containers, unauthorized access to container registries, and anomalous network traffic originating from containers are analyzed to identify potential evasion attempts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may bypass security monitoring by deploying malicious workloads within containers that are less scrutinized than traditional VMs or physical servers. They might exploit misconfigurations in container orchestration tools or use ephemeral containers to hide their activities. Common adversary actions include creating containers with elevated privileges, using obfuscated images from compromised registries, and exploiting API vulnerabilities to deploy unauthorized instances.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - `docker run --privileged -d <malicious_image>`
  - `kubectl create deployment --image=<malicious_image> <deployment_name>`

- **Test Scenarios:**
  - Deploy a container with elevated privileges and monitor for unexpected network activity.
  - Use an unauthorized image from a known compromised registry.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** The strategy may not detect well-obfuscated or highly sophisticated evasion techniques that mimic legitimate traffic patterns.
- **Assumptions:** It assumes that monitoring tools are correctly configured to capture all relevant logs and network traffic. Additionally, it presumes that baseline behavior models are accurate for anomaly detection.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate deployment of containers during scheduled maintenance or updates.
- Authorized use of privileged containers by system administrators for debugging purposes.
- Network spikes due to legitimate business operations involving containerized applications.

## Priority
**High:** This strategy is prioritized as high due to the increasing adoption of container technologies and the sophisticated methods adversaries employ to exploit them. The potential impact includes bypassing security controls, data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no detailed step-by-step instructions are available for emulating this technique in a test environment. However, organizations can simulate adversarial behavior by creating containers with unusual configurations or accessing registries in non-standard ways.

## Response
When an alert fires:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should verify the legitimacy of the container activity and check for any signs of compromise.
2. **Containment Measures:** Isolate suspicious containers to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine how the adversarial attempt bypassed existing security controls and address the underlying vulnerabilities.
4. **Update Security Policies:** Enhance monitoring configurations and update access control policies to mitigate similar threats in the future.
