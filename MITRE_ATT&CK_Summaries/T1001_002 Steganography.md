# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detecting Adversarial Use of Steganography for Command and Control

## Goal
The primary goal of this detection strategy is to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging steganography in containers. This technique aims to detect adversaries who embed malicious scripts within seemingly benign files, such as images or tarballs, which are then executed on the target system to establish command and control channels.

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy utilizes a combination of network traffic analysis, file integrity monitoring, and behavioral analytics to identify potential steganographic activity. Data sources include:

- **Network Traffic:** Analyzing anomalies in data packets that may indicate the presence of hidden payloads.
- **File System Monitoring:** Observing unusual modifications or access patterns to files suspected of containing embedded scripts.
- **Execution Logs:** Detecting uncommon sequences of command executions, particularly involving image processing tools like `steghide` or `exiftool`.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual file size changes that do not correlate with expected content modifications.
- Network traffic to and from known steganography tool domains.
- Execution of scripts following the extraction of files from images or other binary containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often employ steganography to conceal malicious payloads within non-suspicious files. This technique can be particularly effective in evading detection by traditional signature-based systems. In practice, adversaries might use tools like `steghide` on Linux, `ExifTool` on macOS, or `Zamzar` for cross-platform compatibility.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Embedding a script in an image using steganography:
    ```bash
    echo "malicious_script.sh" | steghide embed --cf image.jpg --ef payload.bin --password password123
    ```
  - Extracting and executing the embedded script:
    ```bash
    steghide extract --cf image.jpg --password password123
    ./payload.bin
    ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Advanced steganography techniques that minimize detectable anomalies.
  - Encrypted payloads within files, making content analysis challenging.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Detection relies on the presence of known steganographic tools in network traffic or file system access logs.
  - The strategy assumes adversaries will execute scripts following extraction, which may not always be the case.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of steganography for watermarking images or other media files.
- Normal operations involving tools like `steghide` in non-malicious contexts (e.g., digital forensics).

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass traditional security monitoring using steganography poses a significant threat, as it can facilitate undetected command and control communications. Given the potential for widespread impact across multiple platforms, this detection strategy is of high priority.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Steganographic Tarball Embedding:**
   - Create a tarball containing a benign script.
   - Use `steghide` to embed the tarball into an image:
     ```bash
     tar cvf benign_script.tar benign_script.sh
     echo "password123" | steghide embed --cf test_image.jpg --ef benign_script.tar --password -
     ```

2. **Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage:**
   - Extract the embedded script on a Windows system:
     ```bash
     steghide extract --cf test_image.jpg --password password123
     ```
   - Invoke the script using PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     powershell -Command "Start-Process benign_script.sh"
     ```

3. **Execute Embedded Script in Image via Steganography:**
   - On a Linux system, execute the extracted script:
     ```bash
     tar xvf benign_script.tar
     ./benign_script.sh
     ```

## Response
When an alert fires indicating potential steganographic activity:

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Prevent further network communication to contain any potential threat.
2. **Analyze Suspicious Files:** Use specialized tools to examine the contents of files suspected of containing hidden payloads.
3. **Review Network Traffic:** Look for anomalies or connections to known malicious domains.
4. **Update Detection Signatures:** Incorporate findings into detection systems to improve future identification.
