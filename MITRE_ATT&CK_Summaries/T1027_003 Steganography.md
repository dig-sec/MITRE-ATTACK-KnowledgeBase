# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Steganography

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by embedding sensitive information within seemingly benign files using steganographic methods, specifically focusing on image and audio files.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1027.003 - Steganography
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring and analyzing file metadata, network traffic patterns, and application behavior to identify anomalies indicative of steganographic activities. Key data sources include:

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Detects modifications in known files that may suggest the embedding of hidden information.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Identifies unusual data flows or file transfers containing potential steganographic payloads.
- **Application Logs and Behavior Analytics:** Monitors for applications commonly used for steganography, such as image editors, with unexpected usage patterns.

Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual metadata changes in image/audio files without corresponding application activity.
- Large data payloads being transferred between internal systems or to external endpoints.
- Anomalous behavior from software typically not associated with handling multimedia files.

## Technical Context
Adversaries employ steganography to covertly communicate, exfiltrate data, or deliver malicious content by embedding information in digital media. Common methods include:

- **LSB (Least Significant Bit) Techniques:** Embedding data within the least significant bits of an image file.
- **Transform Domain Methods:** Altering frequency components in audio files.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries might use tools like `Steghide`, `OpenPuff`, or custom scripts to embed data into media files. A sample command for embedding a message using Steghide is:

```bash
steghide embed -ef secret.txt -cf image.jpg
```

Test scenarios could involve:

1. Embedding benign files with hidden payloads.
2. Transferring these files across the network and observing detection systems' responses.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Detection may not cover all steganographic techniques, especially custom or proprietary methods.
  - Encrypted payloads within steganography are challenging to detect without decryption capabilities.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The detection system has visibility over file access and network traffic.
  - Baselines for normal application behavior and file usage patterns exist.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:

- Legitimate use of steganography tools by media professionals or hobbyists.
- Routine updates to multimedia files that incidentally alter metadata.
- Large data transfers involving legitimate multimedia content sharing.

## Priority
**Severity:** High

**Justification:** Steganography can significantly undermine security monitoring efforts by hiding malicious activities. Its ability to bypass traditional detection mechanisms makes it a critical threat vector requiring robust detection strategies.

## Response
When an alert indicating potential steganographic activity fires, analysts should:

1. **Verify the Alert:**
   - Confirm file integrity and metadata changes.
   - Cross-reference network traffic logs for unusual data transfers.

2. **Containment:**
   - Isolate affected systems to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Disable unauthorized applications found on the system.

3. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of the suspected files and network flows.
   - Use steganalysis tools to extract hidden content for further examination.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any embedded malicious payloads.
   - Update security policies and tools to better detect similar attempts in the future.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings and actions taken.
   - Share insights with relevant stakeholders to enhance organizational awareness and defenses.
