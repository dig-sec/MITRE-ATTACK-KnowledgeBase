# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using USB Devices

## Goal
The goal of this detection strategy is to identify and alert on adversarial attempts that leverage removable media, such as USB devices, to bypass security monitoring systems. This technique often facilitates lateral movement within an organization's network by transferring malware or other malicious payloads.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1091 - Replication Through Removable Media
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Lateral Movement, Initial Access
- **Platforms:** Windows

For more details, refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091).

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy utilizes logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools, system event logs, and network traffic analysis. The focus is on identifying patterns such as:
- USB device connection events with unusual attributes or timings.
- File transfers initiated from removable media to internal systems.
- Execution of scripts or binaries originating from USB devices.

Key data sources include Windows Event Logs (e.g., Security, System), EDR solutions capturing endpoint activities, and network traffic monitoring tools for detecting anomalous flows associated with removable media usage.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use removable media to bypass air-gapped environments or systems where direct network access is restricted. This method can be particularly effective in circumventing endpoint security solutions that may not adequately monitor the use of USB devices.

Real-world execution involves:
- Dropping malware payloads onto a USB drive.
- Connecting the infected USB device to a target machine, often exploiting user actions or social engineering.
- Executing malicious scripts or binaries from the USB device to establish persistence or move laterally within the network.

Adversary emulation might include using command-line tools like `attrib` on Windows to hide files and using autorun.inf scripts for automatic execution upon insertion of a USB drive.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes all endpoints generate comprehensive logging data.
- Relies on accurate device recognition; counterfeit or unrecognized devices may bypass detection.
- Does not account for sophisticated obfuscation techniques that might hide malicious activities from traditional logs.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Employees using USB drives for legitimate file transfers.
- Standard software installations via USB media.
- Periodic backups or data synchronization tasks involving removable storage devices.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: The use of removable media can be a critical vector for initial access and lateral movement, especially in environments with strict network controls. Given its potential to bypass security measures undetected, it is essential to prioritize monitoring and detection of such activities.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
### USB Malware Spread Simulation

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Test Environment:** 
   - Set up a controlled Windows environment with logging enabled for Security and System events.
   - Deploy an EDR solution to monitor endpoint activity.

2. **Simulate Malicious Payload:**
   - Create a benign executable script or binary that mimics malware behavior (e.g., logging actions, creating files).
   - Store the payload on a USB drive.

3. **Insert USB Device:**
   - Physically connect the USB device to the test machine.
   - Monitor for connection events in Windows Event Logs and EDR tools.

4. **Execute Malicious Script:**
   - Manually execute the script or binary from the USB device.
   - Observe and log any related activities, such as file creation or network connections initiated by the script.

5. **Analyze Results:**
   - Review logs for unusual activities corresponding to the execution of the payload.
   - Verify that alerts are generated based on predefined patterns (e.g., autorun behavior, unexpected file transfers).

## Response
When an alert is triggered:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected endpoint from the network to prevent further spread.
2. **Investigation:** Analyze logs and EDR data to confirm the presence of malicious activity.
3. **Containment:** Remove any identified malware artifacts from the system.
4. **Remediation:** Apply patches or updates if vulnerabilities were exploited.
5. **Review Policies:** Assess and update security policies regarding removable media usage.
