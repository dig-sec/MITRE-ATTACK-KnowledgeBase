# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring through the use of containers. This involves identifying and responding to malicious activities that exploit containerized environments to evade detection mechanisms typically employed by security solutions.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1587.001 - Malware
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Privileged Remote Environment)
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/001)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on monitoring container orchestration environments to identify suspicious activities indicative of adversarial attempts to bypass security measures. Key data sources include container logs, network traffic, and host system events. Patterns analyzed involve anomalies in container deployment behaviors, unusual process execution within containers, and abnormal inter-container communication.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers due to their isolated nature and the often-limited visibility into their operations by traditional security tools. In real-world scenarios, adversaries may use containers to execute malware or exfiltrate data without detection. Techniques include:
- Using privileged containers to gain elevated access.
- Employing container escape methods to interact with the host system.
- Leveraging ephemeral containers to avoid persistent monitoring.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**
- **Sample Commands:** Executing `docker run -v /:/mnt --privileged` to create a container with host access.
- **Test Scenarios:** Deploy a container with elevated privileges and monitor for unauthorized file access or network connections.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** Detection may be limited by the granularity of logging within the container orchestration platform. Some evasion techniques might not generate detectable artifacts if logs are insufficiently detailed.
- **Assumptions:** It is assumed that adversaries will attempt to interact with the host or other containers in ways that deviate from normal operational patterns.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of privileged containers for development or testing purposes.
- Normal inter-container communication within a microservices architecture.
- Scheduled tasks that involve file access or network operations from within containers.

## Priority
**Severity: High**
Justification: The ability to bypass security monitoring using containers poses a significant threat, as it can lead to undetected malicious activities, including data exfiltration and persistent access. Given the increasing adoption of containerized environments in modern IT infrastructures, addressing this vulnerability is critical.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, there are no specific step-by-step instructions available for emulating this technique in a test environment. However, organizations can develop their own scenarios based on common adversary behaviors and techniques described above.

## Response
When an alert related to adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers is triggered:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected container or host from the network.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of the container's activities, including process execution history and file access logs.
  - Review inter-container communications for signs of unauthorized data transfer.

- **Follow-Up Measures:**
  - Update security policies to restrict the use of privileged containers unless absolutely necessary.
  - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities within the container orchestration platform.
  - Conduct regular audits of container deployments to identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional references or context are available. Organizations should consult their security tool vendors for specific guidance on enhancing container security and detection capabilities.
