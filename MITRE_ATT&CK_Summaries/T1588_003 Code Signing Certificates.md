# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by exploiting vulnerabilities in containerized environments.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1588.003 - Code Signing Certificates
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Resource Development
- **Platforms:** PRE (Post-Compromise Execution)

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/003)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy focuses on identifying unauthorized code signing activities within container environments. It leverages log data from container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker) and endpoint security logs to monitor for anomalies in certificate usage. Patterns analyzed include unusual requests for code signing certificates, atypical signing activities, and discrepancies between known legitimate certificates and those encountered during execution.

## Technical Context
Adversaries may exploit container environments by using stolen or compromised code signing certificates to execute malicious payloads while appearing legitimate. In practice, adversaries might perform the following actions:

- Install unauthorized code-signing tools within containers.
- Request and install fraudulent certificates from internal certificate authorities (CAs).
- Sign malicious executables that are then executed in trusted environments.

Adversary emulation can involve commands like:
```bash
# Simulate requesting a certificate
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt

# Signing an executable with the obtained certificate
codesign --sign "FakeCert" /path/to/executable
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:**
  - Limited visibility into internal CA activities if logs are not fully integrated.
  - Complex container orchestration environments may obscure malicious actions.

- **Assumptions:**
  - Assumes that logging mechanisms for containers and CAs are correctly configured and comprehensive.
  - Trust in the integrity of baseline certificate data used for comparison.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that might trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate software development activities involving code signing within a containerized CI/CD pipeline.
- Routine updates to certificates by authorized personnel using standard procedures.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

The severity is high due to the potential impact of adversaries bypassing security controls and deploying malicious code in trusted environments. This technique can lead to significant breaches if undetected, as it undermines trust in software integrity.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific step-by-step instructions are available for adversary emulation within this context. However, organizations should consider setting up controlled test scenarios that involve:
- Deploying a container environment.
- Using tools to simulate certificate requests and code signing activities.
- Monitoring the system's response to these actions.

## Response
When an alert fires indicating unauthorized code-signing activity:

1. **Verify Activity:** Confirm whether the certificate request or signing was authorized by checking against existing policies and personnel records.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers or environments to prevent further propagation of potential malicious executables.
3. **Investigate Source:** Trace back the origin of the certificate request to determine if it originated from a legitimate user or compromised account.
4. **Revocation:** Revoke any unauthorized certificates and remove them from trusted stores.
5. **Notify Stakeholders:** Inform relevant teams, including IT security and development, about the incident for further action.

## Additional Resources
Currently, no additional resources are available beyond the MITRE ATT&CK framework reference provided.
