# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
This technique aims to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring using scheduled tasks across various platforms. By identifying suspicious activity related to scheduled tasks, organizations can enhance their ability to intercept and mitigate potential threats early in the kill chain phases of Execution, Persistence, and Privilege Escalation.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1053 - Scheduled Task/Job
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS, Containers
- [MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages a combination of log analysis and behavioral heuristics to identify anomalous scheduled tasks. Key data sources include event logs from operating systems (Windows Event Logs, Linux Syslog, macOS Unified Logs) and container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes CronJobs. Patterns analyzed include:
- Creation of new scheduled tasks by non-administrative users.
- Scheduled tasks configured with unusual or high-privilege execution parameters.
- Tasks executing binaries or scripts located in uncommon directories.
- Repeated task failures that could indicate obfuscation attempts.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use scheduled tasks to execute malicious payloads, maintain persistence, or escalate privileges while attempting to blend into normal system operations. In the real world, attackers may leverage PowerShell on Windows, cron jobs on Linux/macOS, or Kubernetes CronJobs in containerized environments to achieve these objectives.

### Adversary Emulation Details
#### Windows Example:
- **Command:** `schtasks /create /tn "MaliciousTask" /tr "C:\Users\Public\malware.exe" /sc daily`
  
#### Linux/macOS Example:
- **Command:** `echo "@reboot root /usr/local/bin/malicious.sh" >> /etc/crontab`

#### Containers Example:
- **Kubernetes CronJob YAML:**
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
  kind: CronJob
  metadata:
    name: malicious-task
  spec:
    schedule: "0 3 * * *"
    jobTemplate:
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: malware-executor
              image: malicious-image
            restartPolicy: OnFailure
  ```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Assumes that the collection of all relevant log data is complete and not tampered with.
- May not detect tasks created directly in memory or via advanced evasion techniques like obfuscation.
- Relies on predefined thresholds for what constitutes unusual behavior, which may vary by organization.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate system maintenance scripts executed as scheduled tasks.
- User-created automation scripts for productivity purposes.
- Scheduled updates to software or applications that follow uncommon paths.

## Priority
**Severity:** High  
Justification: Scheduled tasks are a common vector used by adversaries due to their ability to execute with elevated privileges and persistence capabilities. Early detection is crucial to prevent further exploitation of compromised systems.

## Response
When the alert fires, analysts should:
1. **Verify Task Legitimacy:** Cross-reference the task details with known legitimate operations.
2. **Analyze Execution Context:** Check the user account executing the task and its permissions.
3. **Examine Executable Paths:** Investigate scripts or binaries involved for potential tampering.
4. **Containment Actions:** If malicious activity is confirmed, isolate affected systems to prevent lateral movement.

## Additional Resources
Additional references and context are currently not available. Analysts should refer to internal documentation and incident response protocols tailored to their specific environment.
