# Palantir's Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Detecting Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The primary objective of this detection technique is to identify and counter adversarial attempts that exploit container technologies to evade security monitoring systems. This involves detecting activities where adversaries use containers to obscure their presence, execute malicious payloads undetected, or otherwise bypass established security controls.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources and analysis patterns to identify adversarial use of containers for evasive purposes. Key data sources include:
- **Container Logs:** Monitoring logs from container orchestration systems (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker) to detect unusual activities.
- **Network Traffic Analysis:** Observing network traffic related to containerized applications to spot irregular communication patterns.
- **File Integrity Monitoring:** Ensuring that files within containers have not been altered in a manner consistent with malicious intent.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual spike or drop in resource usage indicative of hidden processes.
- Network communications originating from known malicious IPs.
- Anomalies in container lifecycle events (e.g., unexpected restarts).

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit container technologies by deploying containers that can operate without detection by traditional security systems. They may do this by:
- **Leveraging Insecure Configurations:** Setting up containers with weak security configurations to avoid triggering alerts.
- **Obfuscation Techniques:** Using multi-layered containers or nested containers to hide malicious activities from monitoring tools.

### Adversary Emulation Details
To emulate adversarial behavior, a test scenario may involve:
1. Deploying a benign container that mimics suspicious characteristics such as excessive resource usage or unusual network communications.
2. Altering configuration files within the container in ways typically associated with malicious intent (e.g., disabling logging).

Sample commands for emulation might include:
```shell
docker run -d --name test_container <image_name>
```
This command runs a container, which can then be manipulated to simulate adversarial behavior.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spot:** Limited visibility into containers orchestrated by third-party cloud providers.
- **Assumption:** The detection system assumes that baseline normal behaviors are well established for accurate anomaly detection.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate spikes in resource usage due to application loads or updates.
- Regular network communications from trusted sources.

To minimize these, contextual awareness and baselining are critical components of the detection strategy.

## Priority
**Severity: High**
The use of containers by adversaries poses a significant risk due to the increasing reliance on container technologies across industries. The ability for attackers to bypass security monitoring can lead to substantial breaches if not promptly detected and mitigated.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific steps are available for adversary emulation within this strategy framework. However, future developments may include detailed test scenarios based on evolving threat intelligence.

## Response
Upon detection of an alert indicating adversarial use of containers:
1. **Isolate the affected container(s)** to prevent further potential harm.
2. **Conduct a thorough forensic analysis** to identify any changes or malicious payloads within the container.
3. **Review security configurations** and update policies to close any identified vulnerabilities.

## Additional Resources
As part of ongoing efforts, it's recommended to stay updated with industry best practices and threat intelligence reports related to container security and adversarial tactics.
