# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring systems by leveraging container technologies. Attackers may exploit containers to obscure malicious activities, as they can run isolated environments that are often less scrutinized than traditional operating system processes.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy involves monitoring for suspicious container activity that may indicate an attempt to bypass security systems. The data sources include logs from container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker), network traffic analysis, and system event logs from Windows hosts running containers.

Patterns analyzed include:
- Unusual or unauthorized use of containerization tools.
- Network traffic anomalies between containers and external entities.
- Changes in host configurations that suggest the presence of containers.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit container technologies to create isolated environments where they can operate without detection. They may use containers to deploy payloads, evade security controls, or establish command-and-control channels.

**Real-world Execution:**
Adversaries might use tools like Docker or Kubernetes to spin up containers that execute malicious code. These containers can be configured to hide their network traffic or disguise their activities as benign processes.

**Sample Commands for Emulation:**
- `docker run -d --name malicious_container some_malicious_image`
- `kubectl create deployment mal_deploy --image=malicious_image`

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- Detection may not cover all container technologies, especially those that are custom or proprietary.
- Assumes comprehensive logging of container activities is enabled on the host systems.
- Relies on baseline knowledge of normal container usage within the environment.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities that could trigger false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of containers for development and testing purposes.
- Network traffic from containers used in automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Standard operations by IT teams deploying or managing containers.

## Priority
**Severity: High**

Justification: Containers are increasingly used as a vector for sophisticated attacks due to their ability to isolate processes and evade traditional security mechanisms. The potential impact of undetected adversarial activities within containers is significant, necessitating high priority in detection strategies.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a test environment, follow these steps:

1. **Windows - Discover domain trusts with dsquery:**
   ```bash
   dsquery * "(&(objectCategory=computer)(cn=<hostname>))"
   ```

2. **Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest:**
   ```bash
   nltest /dsgetdc:<domain_name>
   ```

3. **Powershell enumerate domains and forests:**
   ```powershell
   Get-ADForest | Select-Object Name, DomainNamingMaster, InfrastructureMaster
   Get-ADDomain | Select-Object DNSRoot, PDCRoleOwner
   ```

4. **Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs:**
   ```bash
   adfind ou -b <base_dn>
   ```

5. **Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts:**
   ```bash
   adfind trust
   ```

6. **Get-DomainTrust with PowerView:**
   ```powershell
   Get-DomainTrust
   ```

7. **Get-ForestTrust with PowerView:**
   ```powershell
   Get-ForestTrust
   ```

8. **TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure:**
   Use TruffleHog to scan repositories for secrets and sensitive information.

## Response
When an alert fires, analysts should:
- Immediately isolate the affected container and host.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the container's activities and network traffic.
- Review logs from container orchestration platforms and host systems.
- Determine if any data exfiltration or lateral movement occurred.
- Update security policies to prevent similar incidents.

## Additional Resources
- **PUA - AdFind Suspicious Execution:** Monitoring for unexpected usage patterns with AdFind tools.
- **Potential Recon Activity Via Nltest.EXE:** Identifying reconnaissance attempts using network location test commands.
- **Nltest.EXE Execution:** Understanding and monitoring the execution of network location tests.

By following this strategy, organizations can enhance their detection capabilities against adversaries leveraging container technologies to bypass security measures.
