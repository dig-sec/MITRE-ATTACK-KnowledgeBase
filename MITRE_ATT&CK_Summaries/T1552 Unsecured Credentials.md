# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Framework: Detect Adversarial Attempts to Bypass Security Monitoring Using Containers

## Goal
This detection strategy aims to identify adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring mechanisms by exploiting container environments. The focus is on recognizing unauthorized access and lateral movement within containerized infrastructure.

## Categorization

- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1552 - Unsecured Credentials
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Credential Access
- **Platforms:** Windows, Azure AD, Office 365, SaaS, IaaS, Linux, macOS, Google Workspace, Containers

## Strategy Abstract

The detection strategy leverages a combination of data sources including container logs, access control lists, and network traffic patterns to identify anomalous behavior indicative of credential misuse or unauthorized access. Patterns analyzed include:

- Unusual login attempts from containers.
- Access to sensitive resources without proper authentication.
- Abnormal configuration changes in container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes).
  
This strategy emphasizes correlation between user activity logs and system alerts to detect suspicious activities that may indicate credential exploitation.

## Technical Context

Adversaries often exploit unsecured credentials within container environments by:

1. **Credential Dumping:** Extracting sensitive information such as passwords or API keys from containers.
2. **Misconfigured Permissions:** Using default or weak permissions to gain unauthorized access.
3. **Lateral Movement:** Moving laterally across networked containers using compromised credentials.

**Adversary Emulation Details:**

- **Sample Commands:** Attempting `docker exec` with elevated privileges, `kubectl` commands for accessing Kubernetes clusters without proper RBAC setup.
- **Test Scenarios:** Simulate credential access by running unauthorized container commands or modifying configurations to observe alert triggers.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions

- **Blind Spots:**
  - Encrypted traffic within containers might hide malicious activities.
  - Adversaries using sophisticated evasion techniques may not trigger alerts consistently.

- **Assumptions:**
  - The underlying security monitoring tools are adequately integrated with the container orchestration platforms.
  - Security teams have baseline visibility into normal operations of containerized environments.

## False Positives

Potential benign activities that might lead to false positives include:

- Legitimate administrative access during maintenance windows.
- Automated scripts or CI/CD pipelines accessing containers as part of routine tasks.
- Misconfigurations in logging settings leading to repetitive alerts on non-critical events.

## Priority

**Severity: High**

This detection strategy is prioritized highly due to the critical nature of unsecured credentials within container environments, which can lead to significant security breaches if exploited. The pervasive use of containers across industries amplifies the potential impact of such vulnerabilities.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **AWS - Retrieve EC2 Password Data using stratus:**
   - Set up an AWS environment with EC2 instances.
   - Deploy a containerized application and configure it to store passwords or sensitive data within volumes.
   - Use `stratus` to extract password data from the EC2 instance's storage.

2. **Search for Passwords in Powershell History:**
   - On a Windows host, initiate PowerShell sessions with potential credential usage.
   - Intentionally enter credentials and manipulate configuration files.
   - Search the PowerShell history logs for instances of stored passwords or API keys.

## Response

When an alert related to this strategy is triggered:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Analysts should immediately investigate the context and scope of the detected anomaly, focusing on user identities involved and access patterns.
2. **Containment:** Isolate affected containers and restrict network communication if lateral movement is suspected.
3. **Credential Revocation:** Rotate credentials for any compromised accounts or services identified during the investigation.
4. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the adversary's entry point, methods used, and extent of access gained.

## Additional Resources

- None available currently; further resources may be developed as the strategy evolves with industry practices and emerging threats.
