# Alerting & Detection Strategy: Detect Adversarial Use of Asymmetric Cryptography for Command and Control

## Goal
The goal of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by using asymmetric cryptography for command-and-control (C2) communications. This often involves adversaries leveraging encrypted channels to mask their activities from detection systems.

## Strategy Abstract
The detection strategy leverages multiple data sources such as network traffic logs, endpoint telemetry, and cryptographic key management systems to identify patterns indicative of asymmetric cryptography being used for C2 purposes. Key indicators include unusual public/private key exchanges, the presence of non-standard encryption algorithms or protocols, and encrypted communications from unexpected origins.

Data is analyzed to spot:
- Unusual certificate issuance requests.
- Encryption patterns inconsistent with normal organizational activities.
- Connections originating from endpoints with known malware signatures or suspicious behavior.

## Technical Context
Adversaries often use asymmetric cryptography to establish secure C2 channels. This involves the generation of key pairs (public and private keys) where the public key is used by the adversary's infrastructure, while the endpoint hosts the corresponding private key. The encrypted communication ensures that only those with access to the private key can decrypt the messages, making detection more challenging.

In real-world scenarios, adversaries might:
- Distribute malware that generates a unique pair of asymmetric keys per victim.
- Use public-key cryptography protocols like SSH or HTTPS with custom certificates for C2 communications.
- Exploit legitimate services by embedding malicious payloads within encrypted traffic flows to evade signature-based detection.

Adversary emulation can include setting up test environments where key exchanges are simulated using tools such as OpenSSH, generating fake certificates, and analyzing network traffic to identify the communication patterns typical of C2 operations.

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** Detection may miss novel implementations or custom protocols not previously encountered.
- **Assumptions:** Assumes a baseline understanding of normal key usage patterns within the organization. It also presumes availability and integration of endpoint detection solutions capable of deep packet inspection for encrypted traffic.

## False Positives
Potential false positives include:
- Legitimate use of encryption by authorized applications or services, such as VPNs, secure file transfers, and proprietary enterprise software.
- Routine cryptographic operations during legitimate administrative activities like software updates or remote access sessions.

## Priority
**High:** Given the potential for asymmetric cryptography to significantly obfuscate malicious C2 traffic, detecting this technique is crucial. The ability to maintain operational security against such advanced techniques is essential to prevent adversaries from conducting prolonged and undetected campaigns within an organization's network.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
Currently, no specific adversary emulation instructions are available. However, setting up a controlled environment with tools like Wireshark for packet analysis and Metasploit for generating test key exchanges can help simulate the detection process.

## Response
When alerts indicating potential asymmetric cryptography misuse fire:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Quarantine affected endpoints to prevent further communication.
2. **Detailed Analysis:** Investigate network logs, endpoint telemetry, and cryptographic key management data to confirm the alert's validity.
3. **Threat Hunting:** Conduct proactive searches for similar activities across other parts of the network.
4. **Incident Documentation:** Record findings and responses thoroughly for post-incident analysis and future reference.

## Additional Resources
As this technique involves specialized detection strategies, additional resources would typically include in-depth guides on network traffic analysis, key management systems' logs examination, and training materials for threat hunting focused on encrypted communications. Currently, no specific resources are listed beyond the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002) reference.

This structured approach should aid organizations in enhancing their detection capabilities against adversaries leveraging asymmetric cryptography for C2 purposes, ensuring robust network security postures.
