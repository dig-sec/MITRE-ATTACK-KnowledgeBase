# Alerting & Detection Strategy (ADS) Report

## Goal
The objective of this technique is to detect adversarial attempts to bypass security monitoring by leveraging unquoted service paths in Windows environments.

## Categorization
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping:** T1574.009 - Path Interception by Unquoted Path
- **Tactic / Kill Chain Phases:** Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion
- **Platforms:** Windows

[MITRE ATT&CK Reference](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

## Strategy Abstract
This detection strategy utilizes system and security logs to identify unquoted service paths that adversaries exploit to gain persistence or escalate privileges. Key data sources include:
- System event logs for new or altered services.
- Security event logs tracking privilege use and service account activity.

Patterns analyzed involve monitoring for services with paths lacking quotes, which could allow attackers to manipulate directory traversal or execute arbitrary code upon service startup.

## Technical Context
Adversaries exploit unquoted service path vulnerabilities in Windows by registering services that point to malicious executables. Due to the absence of quotation marks around the path in the registry entry, Windows interprets the first space-separated token as a file and the rest as its directory path, leading to potential execution of unintended files.

### Adversary Emulation Details
Adversaries typically execute this technique using administrative privileges to:
1. Create or modify services with unquoted paths.
2. Use tools like `sc.exe` for service manipulation.

Sample Command:
```bash
sc create myService binPath= C:\malicious\program.exe
```

## Blind Spots and Assumptions
- **Blind Spots:** The strategy may miss dynamically created services or those modified post-deployment.
- **Assumptions:** It assumes that all service paths are logged correctly in system logs.

## False Positives
Potential benign activities triggering false alerts include:
- Legitimate use of unquoted paths by poorly configured applications.
- Services intentionally designed with specific directory structures that do not require quotes.

## Priority
**Priority: High**

Justification: Unquoted path exploitation can lead to significant security breaches, allowing adversaries persistence and elevated privileges, which could facilitate further network compromise.

## Validation (Adversary Emulation)
To emulate this technique in a controlled test environment:

1. **Preparation:** Ensure administrative access on the Windows machine.
2. **Execution of Program as Service:**
   - Open Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
   - Execute the following command to create a service with an unquoted path:
     ```bash
     sc create TestService binPath= C:\test\program.exe start= auto
     ```
3. **Verification:** Check if `TestService` is listed in services.msc and observe its behavior.

## Response
When an alert for an unquoted service path fires, analysts should:

1. **Investigate the Service:**
   - Examine the service's configuration and associated binaries.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the executable file linked to the service.

2. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Remove or disable any suspicious services.
   - Ensure all paths are properly quoted in future configurations.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Record findings, actions taken, and update incident response protocols as necessary.
